a slot machine win or that rituals improve luck, even after repeated losses Or continuing to gamble believing that you will eventually win even though it is statistically unlikely Hindsight Bias# Description# Tendency to see past events as having been predictable (I knew along) after they occur, reinforcing overconfidence in initial beliefs and resisting revision Key example# After a market crash- \u0026ldquo;I knew it was going to crash\u0026rdquo;, even if the pre-crash predictions were optimistic Processing Errors# Anchoring and Adjustment Bias# Description# Over-relying on the first piece of information (the anchor) when making decisions, the insufficiently adjusting from it Key example# Asked \u0026ldquo;Is the Mississippi River longer than 500 miles?\u0026rdquo; then estimating 600 miles; if asked \u0026ldquo;longer than 5,000 miles?\u0026rdquo;, estimating 4,000 miles—even though actual length is —2,300 miles.

Availability Bias# Description# Judging likelihood or frequency by how easily examples come to mind, rather than actual data Key example# After seeing news about shark attacks, overestimating the risk of swimming; or fearing plane crashes more than car accidents due to vivid media coverage. Behavioral biases# Loss-Aversion Bias# Description# The pain of a loss is twice as much as the pleasure of a similar gain; therefore we prefer to avoid losses over acquiring gains Key example# Reusing to sell a stock down $1,000 in order to avoid realizing the loss, but not buying more of the stock when it is up $1,000 Disposition effect# Description# Selling winning investments to soon in order to lock in gains, and holding losing investments too long to avoid realizing losses Key example# An investor quickly sells a stock up 20% but holds one down 20% hoping it comes back Overconfidence Bias# Description# Overestimating one\u0026rsquo;s own knowledge, predictive ability, or control over outcomes Key example# A trader believing they can beat the market consistently despite average returns; or a driver claiming \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m above average\u0026rdquo; (statistically impossible for most).

If the seller accepts your $2,500 and you know that this is the outcome of asymmetric information, you won’t buy the car Example: Why cars lose a lot of value when they are driven off of the lot Because we do not know much about the person who is buying the car and do not know how they would treat it Additional definitions# Principal-agent relationship Principal designs a contract specifying payments to the agent as a function of his or her performance, and the agent takes an action that influences performance and thus the payment of the principal amount The principal provides incentives for another party to work on the principal\u0026rsquo;s benefit Moral hazard Actions that are taken by one party but are relevant for and not observed by the other party in the transaction Example: people with air bags in their cars are more likely to get into accidents. Why? Two explanations 1. Adverse selection—if you know that you are a bad driver, you are more likely to choose a car that has air bags. 2. Moral hazard—if you are protected from some of the risk of driving, you are more likely to drive recklessly. An employee in a department store often steals goods when other employees are not around.

The merchandising journal entry problem will include more types of transactions (some basic expenses, discounts, etc.) and the manufacturing transactions will primarily focus on the movement of value throughout the inventory accounts out of cost of goods sold.\nCHAPTER 4\nYou need to know the basic calculation for overhead with a single, multiple, and activity predetermined overhead rates.\nYou will also get definitional questions on activity based costing, activity based management, just-in-time management, and total quality management with quality costs.\n**MULTIPLE CHOICE \u0026amp; TERMINOLOGY **\nA number of concepts and characteristics in merchandising and manufacturing companies were covered in the material. There will be Multiple Choice questions that consider you general knowledge regarding other material in the covered chapters, so you need to review the lectures and lecture notes carefully.\nTerminology will, again, be an important part of the exam. Review the lectures and lecture notes, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with the different terms across the chapters.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/notes/semester-3/is-301/class-notes/chapter-1-technology-and-the-modern-enterprise/","title":"Chapter 1 Technology and the Modern Enterprise","section":"Class Notes","content":" Market capitalizations: The market cap of a publicly traded firm is its total value. Market cap can be calculated by multiplying the number of a firms shares by its current share price. R\u0026amp;D: Research and development—the portion of a firm focused on innovation, typically pioneering advances that will eventually arrive as new products and technologies. Microprocessors: The part of the computer that executes the instructions of a computer program. Server farms: A massive network of computer servers running software to coordinate their collective use. Server farms provide the infrastructure backbone to SaaS and hardware cloud efforts, as well as many large-scale Internet services. Pivoting: In product development and entrepreneurship, this involves significantly redefining the market, business, and/or product offering. Term Sheet: A legal document that is the agreement between a founding firm and its investors. It defines investment terms, ownership stake, board membership if offered, etc. The Hype Cycle: Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, and Plateau of Productivity.

When the value of a product or service increases as its number of users expands. Platforms: Products and services that allow for the development and integration of software products and other complementary goods, effectively creating an ecosystem of value-added offerings. Windows, iOS, the Kindle, and the standards that allow users to create Facebook apps are all platforms. Staying power: The long-term viability of a product or service. Switching costs: The cost a consumer incurs when moving from one product to another. It can involve actual money spent (ex. Buying a new product) as well as investments in time, any data loss, and so forth. Complementary benefits: Products or services that add additional value to the primary product or service that makes up a network. APIs: Programming hooks, or guidelines, published by firms that tell other programs how to get a service to perform a task, such as send or receive data. For example, Amazon provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to let developers write their own applications and websites that can send the firm orders. Daily Active Users (DAU): Also known by the acronym DAU, this refers to the number of unique visitors, on average, who use a product or service. Customer acquisition costs: The amount of money a firm spends to convince a customer to buy (or in the case of free products, try or use) a product or service. Metaverse: Immersive digital worlds. The term metaverse was coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. The term has become so ubiquitous that it inspired Facebook to rebrand itself as Meta. One-sided market: A market that derives most of its value from a single class of users (e.g., instant messaging). Same-side exchange benefits: Benefits derived by interaction among members of a single class of participant (e.g., the exchange value when increasing numbers of IM users gain the ability to message each other). Two-sided market: Network market that comprises two distinct categories of participant, both of which are needed to deliver value for the network to work (e.g., video game console owners and developers of video games). Cross-side exchange benefit: When an increase in the number of users on one side of the market (console owners, for example) creates a rise in the other side (software developers). Monopoly: A market where there are many buyers but only one dominant seller. Oligopoly: A market dominated by a small number of powerful sellers. Technological leapfrogging: Competing by offering a new technology that is so superior to existing offerings that the value overcomes the total resistance that older technologies might enjoy via exchange, switching cost, and complementary benefits. Social proof: The positive influence created when someone finds out that others are doing something. Blue ocean strategy: An approach where firms seek to create and compete in uncontested “blue ocean” market spaces, rather than competing in spaces and ways that have attracted many similar rivals. Convergence: When two or more markets, once considered distinctly separate, begin to offer features and capabilities. As an example: The markets for mobile phones and media players have converted (and smartphones won). Envelopment: When one market attempts to conquer a new market by making it a subset, component, or feature of its primary offering. Backward compatibility: The ability to take advantage of complementary products developed for a prior generation of technology. Adaptor: A product that allows a firm to tap into the complementary products, data, or user base of another product or service. The Osborne Effect: When a firm preannounces a forthcoming product or service and experiences a sharp and detrimental drop in sales of current offerings as users wait for the new item. Congestion effects: When increasing numbers of users lower the value of a product or service. Exchange value: The quantitative ratio at which one commodity is exchanged for another—often expressed as its price in money.

Data aggregators: Firms that collect and resell data. Legacy systems: Older information systems that are often incompatible with other systems, technologies, and ways of conducting business. Incompatible legacy systems can be a major roadblock to turning data into information, and they can inhibit firm agility, holding back operational and strategic initiatives. Data warehouse: A set of databases designed to support decision-making in an organization. Data mart: A database or databases focused on addressing the concerns of a specific problem (e.g., increasing customer retention, improving product quality) or business unit (e.g., marketing, engineering). Online analytical processing (OLAP): A method of querying and reporting that takes data from standard relational databases, calculates and summarizes the data, and then stores the data in a special database called a data cube. Data cube: A special database used to store data in OLAP reporting. Data lake: A catch-all term for storage and access technologies used in Big Data. Data lakes are systems that allow for the storage of data in both structured as well as “raw,” “unfiltered” formats. Data lakes also provide the tools to “pipe out” data, filter it, and refine it so that it can be turned into information. Hadoop: A set of mostly open source tools to manage massive amounts of unstructured data for storage, extraction, and computation. Data cloud: Sometimes referred to as cloud data warehousing, this term refers to a cloud service that provides tools to extract and transform data from disparate sources so that it can be interrogated as needed. Unlike data warehouses, data lakes, or similar tools that an organization might run on-site, a data cloud can be spun up to temporarily hold a very large amount of data for short-term use, then be disbanded when it is no longer needed. Snowflake is the best known of the many firms providing services in this space. ETL: Extract, Transform, Load—copying data from multiple, disparately organized data sources, transforming (or cleaning) the data into a common format, and loading it into a combined usable format. ETL is a key step in getting data into a data warehouse or data mart. Query tools: Tools to interrogate a data source or multiple sources and return a subset of data, possibly summarized, based on a set of criteria. Python: A general purpose programming language that is also popular for data analytics. R: A programming language specifically created for analytics, statistical, and graphical computing. Graphical query tools: Tools that allow a user to create a query through a point-and-click or drag-and-drop interface, rather than requiring programming knowledge. Canned reports: Reports that provide regular summaries of information in a performative format. Ad Hoc reporting tools: Tools that put users in control so that they can create custom reports on an as-needed basis by selecting fields, ranges, summary conditions, and other parameters. Dashboards: A heads-up display of critical indicators that allow managers to get a graphical glance at key performance metrics. Data visualization: The graphical representation of data and information. Generative AI: A type of artificial intelligence whose output is some type of media: e.g., text, images, audio, video. Results are usually generated based on a prompt, such as typed or spoken text. This technology “learns” the patterns and structure of data used during training, and can then generate new output based on the characteristics of this input. Results can often be refined by further prompt entry. Omnichannel: Providing customers with a unified experience across customer channels, which may include online, mobile, catalog, phone, and retail. Pricing, recommendations, and incentives should reflect a data-driven, accurate, single view of the customer. Data mining: The process of using computers to identify hidden patterns in, and to build models from, large datasets. Over-engineer: Build a model with so many variables that the solution arrived at might only work on the subset of data you’ve used to create it.

And How Do We Get There?”# The IP Address# - Every device connected to the internet has an IP adress - **IP address** - A value used to identify a device that is connected to the Internet. IP addresses are usually expressed as four numbers (from 0 to 255), separated by periods. - The internet provider \u0026quot;lends\u0026quot; a device an IP address - The original IP address standard was IPv4 - expressed as a string and 0 and 255 - We have run out of IPv4 addresses - Ways to address this through **Network Address Translation** - Uses a gateway that allows multiple devices to share a single IP address - However, to truly solve this issue, we must switch to IPv6, but this is not backwards compatible with the IPv4 standard - There are schemes to help delay the impact of this IP address drought The DNS: The Internet’s Phone Book# - Can type the IP address into a Web browser, and the page will show up - Does not help end users that much - DNS helps to prevent this - Basically a phone book that has the IP address associated with a hostname - The phonebook is a nameserver - The resolver does not know everything, but it knows where to start a lookup that will find the address that you are looking for. - Resolver will contact one of 13 root name servers - Acts as a starting place - Does not have one big list, but can point to one of the nameservers for the next level (ex: the .com nameserver) - Will eventually find the IP address of the nameserver of the website/resource - The resolver will remember where it found the nameserver for a while, to ensure quicker delivery to others - Cache is refreshed occasionally to make sure the data remains accurate - This system also ensures that the DNS system is fault-tolerant - ![An example of how DNS works](https://resized-images.flatworldknowledge.com/gallaugher_7-32630/1600/gallaugher_7-32630-fig139.png) - Getting Where You’re Going# TCP/IP: The Internet’s Secret Sauce# TCP/IP - also referred to as the internet protocol suite Built into any device used to connect to the internet Operate below http and other applications TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Works at both ends of most Internet communications to ensure a perfect copy of a message is sent. Web page sliced into packets (datagrams) Everything on the web is divided into one or more packets UDP (User datagram protocol) is the less reliable version of TCP used for live streaming media applications where it would be near impossible to achieve the fault tolerance of TCP IP (Internet Protocol) - Routing protocol that is in charge of forwarding packets on the Internet. Packets may have to travel over several networks in order to get where they are going Done via routers Routers speak to each other using IP (they also have IP addresses) Routers do not have a perfect set of information on all points of the internet, but talk to each other and know the general idea of where to send the packets This makes it fault tolerant Once packets are received by the local machine, TCP checks the validity of the packets and that all packets that have been requested have been received correctly VOIP (Voice over Internet) - Removes some of the need to have 2 separate networks - one for phone service and one for regular network What Connects the Routers and Computers?# Local connections are most commonly done with traditional ethernet cables (copper) Transmissions over longer distances are accomplished via Fiber (typically) Wireless over wifi for shorter distances and over cell phone tower or satellite over longer distances Laptop to Wifi to base station to LAN to Fiber Optic to ISP Peering - Where different internet service providers connect their equipment in order to share traffic Typically done at internet exchange points (IXPs) Some firms also sometimes have Private peering points ISPs make money by charging the endpoints of the network (the users) for access to the network Last Mile: Faster Speed, Broader Access# Internet backbone - High-speed data lines provided by many firms all across the world that interconnect and collectively form the core of the Internet. Backbone transmission speeds are typically now around 100 Gbps Increasing speed all the time Overall network speed is determined by Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s law - A system’s speed is determined by its slowest component. The bottleneck is the last mile- how customers are able to connect to the internet US is pretty bad in terms of broadband internet access Bandwidth is bits per second Cable Broadband# 90% of US homes are serviced by a cable provider Coaxial cable - Insulated copper cable commonly used by cable television providers. Firms are starting to develop new technologies to replace or substitute coax in order to increase speeds DSL: Phone Company Copper# Digital Subscriber line (DSL) - Broadband technology that uses the wires of a local telephone network. Speeds range from 7mbps to 100 mbps (although that is over short distances) Since this technology uses standard telephone wiring, there is no shielding on the cable, there is no way to prevent signal drop-off Only really works well in cities where high-value customers can be accessed over short distances Popular in Asia Fiber: A Light-Filled Glass Pipe to Your Doorstep# Also known as FTTH Fastest last-mile technology Works over long distances Technology is not already in place Most firms build their own fiber network implementation- large costs Wireless# Mostly delivered through cell towers Wireless spectrum - Frequencies used for wireless communication. Most mobile cell phone services have to license spectrum. Some technologies (such as Wi-Fi) use unlicensed public spectrum. Bidding to rights for certain parts of the spectrum by service providers Need more bandwith T-Mobile arguing for the FCC to set aside more bandwidth for smaller carriers Increasing amount of content on our phones 5G: A Faster Wireless Network, but Not All 5G Is the Same# - Speed is related to the wireless spectrum that the firm has licensed - T-Mobile has a large and high speed 5G network due to its usage of the C band, much of which was acquired when it purchased Sprint - Others have struggled because the spectrums that they have may offer good range, but slower speeds - 5G home internet uses satellite dishes instead of phones - UWB vs typical 5G Satellite Wireless and Schemes to Reach the Remote# - GEO satellite internet - Increasing amount of satellites launched in LEO - Amazon Leo - Starlink - However, the cost of this service is significant Wi-Fi and Other Hotspots# - Needs to be in range of the base station or hotspot - Typically around 300 feet - Wi-Fi equipped mobile devices can sometimes act as their own personal hotspot - Bluetooth as a replacement for speaker cables and the like Net Neutrality: What\u0026rsquo;s Fair?# Net Neutrality - The principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally, and ISPs should not discriminate, slow down access, or charge differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or modes of communication. Google believes that ISPs should not be entitled to control activity online ISPs could restrict content (ex: Comcast restricting content streamed) A continuing US policy discussion over the last several years To Infinity and Beyond: SpaceX Starlink and the Awesome Power Wielded by Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s Firms# Many firms have failed at the promise of creating global broadband Iridium went bankrupt The One World consortium had to be bailed out by the British government and later acquired by French firm Eutelsat Musk is the only one who has delivered on his promise of global-spanning broadband Older satellite constellations orbited in GEO GEO - Geosynchronous Earth Orbit. GEO satellites orbit the Earth at a fixed position, roughly 22,000 miles (35,000 km) above the Earth—roughly the same distance as the Earth\u0026rsquo;s circumference. This distance means fewer satellites can cover a larger geographic distance, but it also increases latency due to the time taken to send a signal from ground antennas to satellites and back. Starlink satellites orbit in LEO LEO - Low Earth Orbit. LEO satellites orbit the Earth at a range of less than 1,200 miles (2,000 km), and may be significantly less (Starlink satellites are about 340 miles or 550km up). A closer distance means more satellites are needed to cover a smaller geographic broadcast/receive footprint, and that satellites will regularly move in and out of range above a given point, so most LEO efforts deploy many more satellites than their GEO counterparts. The big advantage of LEO over GEO is speed—with latency being smaller, transmission speeds are much faster than GEO efforts. Starlink satellites orbit makes the signal transmission time take 1/60th of the time Starlink is so fast that it is considered to be an alternative for some ground based networks Starlink satellites are not in a fixed position, but rather pass signals to each each other using lasers Starlink satellites are about the size of a couch, unlike GEO satellites that are the size of school busses Starlink currently has approximately 9,000 satellites in orbit There is a lot of room between the satellites in orbit SpaceX taps into the US Governments Space Debris Collision Detection System Starlink satellites have enough propulsion to move itself out of orbit when it has exceed it useful life Satellite typically last around 3.5 years before they are deorbited Solar events can lead to early reentry Worry about a collision that may lead to a cascading catastrophe Kessler effect - A feared cascading effect when colliding space debris hits existing objects, creating additional debris and additional collisions. 42 million people in the rural United States that lack access to high-speed broadband 3 billion people are not online yet in the world Starlink is not cheap - $600 for equipment, $99/month of unlimited Much of SpaceX\u0026rsquo;s evaluation is driven by the future success of Starlink T-Mobile and Starlink to cover gaps in the networks Already used widely throughout the world, especially in areas torn apart by war, or by natural disasters Ukraine war - 42,000 terminals Has used geofencing to prevent Starlink use outside of the current theater of conflict Geofencing - A geofence is a virtual perimeter around a physical location. Geofencing is often used to send alerts when a device is detected within or outside an area of intended operation.

Operational effectiveness: Performing the same tasks better than rivals perform them. Commodity: A basic good that can be interchanged with nearly identical offerings by others—think milk, coal, orange juice, or, to a lesser extent, Windows PCs and Android phones. The more commoditized an offering, the greater the likelihood that competition will be based on price. Fast follower problem: Exists when savvy rivals watch a pioneer’s efforts, learn from their successes and missteps, then enter the market quickly with a comparable or superior product at a lower cost before the first mover can dominate. Augmented-reality: A technology that superimposes content, such as images and animation, on top of real-world images. Strategic positioning: Performing different tasks than rivals, or the same tasks in a different way. Resource-based view of competitive advantage: The strategic thinking approach suggesting that if a firm is to maintain sustainable competitive advantage, it must control an exploitable resource, or set of resources, that have four critical characteristics. These resources must be (1) valuable, (2) rare, (3) imperfectly imitable, and (4) nonsubstitutable. Dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM): A technology that increases the transmission capacity (and hence speed) of fiber-optic cable. Transmissions using fiber are accomplished by transmitting light inside “glass” cables. In DWDM, the light inside fiber is split into different wavelengths in a way similar to how a prism splits light into different colors. Imitation-resistant value chain: A way of doing business that competitors struggle to replicate and that frequently involves technology in a key enabling role. Value chain: The set of activities through which a product or service is created and delivered to customers. Straddled: In strategic management, this refers to a firm\u0026rsquo;s attempt to occupy more than one position, while failing to match the benefits of a more efficient, singularly focused rival. Brand: The symbolic embodiment of all the information connected with a product or service. Viral marketing: Leveraging consumers to promote a product or service. Scale advantages: Advantages related to size. Economies of scale: When costs can be spread across increasing units of production or in serving multiple customers. Businesses that have favorable economies of scale (like many Internet firms) are sometimes referred to as being highly scalable. Network effects: Also known as Metcalfe’s Law, or network externalities. When the value of a product or service increases as its number of users expands. Bundling: Selling products available separately as a single package. Bundling can be especially effective when a software product or service is included with a hardware product. Bundling can also be tricky as it can raise a risk of unfair competitive practices, especially if a firm has a monopoly or otherwise large amount of market control. APIs: Programming hooks, or guidelines, published by firms that tell other programs how to get a service to perform a task such as send or receive data. For example, Amazon provides APIs to let developers write their own applications and websites that can send the firm orders. Affiliates: Third parties that promote a product or service, typically in exchange for a cut of any sales. Non-practicing entities: Commonly known as patent trolls, these firms make money by acquiring and asserting patents, rather than bringing products and services to market. Private: As in “to go private” or “take a firm private.” Buying up a publicly traded firm’s shares. Usually done when a firm has suffered financially and when a turnaround strategy will first yield losses that would further erode share price. Firms (often called private equity, buyout, LBO, or leveraged buyout firms) that take another company private hope to improve results so that the company can be sold to another firm or they can reissue shares on public markets. Porter’s five forces: Also known as Industry and Competitive Analysis. A framework considering the interplay between (1) the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, (2) the threat of new entrants, (3) the threat of substitute goods or services, (4) the bargaining power of buyers, and (5) the bargaining power of suppliers. Price transparency: The degree to which complete information is available. Information asymmetry: A decision situation where one party has more or better information than its counterparty.

Introduction: The Great Pivot# Netflix is a rare example of a firm that disrupted itself to survive. Under CEO Reed Hastings, the firm transitioned from a DVD-by-mail giant (which obliterated Blockbuster) to the global leader in streaming.\nKey Statistics (as of Fall 2023):\nSubscribers: 247 million globally. Reach: Available in every country except China, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Engagement: In the U.S., Netflix beats Hulu by a factor of \u0026gt;3 in teen viewership. Resilience: Despite competition from Disney and Warner Bros., Netflix stock gained 45% in 2023 while rivals struggled. 2. Atoms to Bits: The Economic Shift# The transition from physical media (\u0026ldquo;atoms\u0026rdquo;) to digital streaming (\u0026ldquo;bits\u0026rdquo;) fundamentally changed the business mechanics.\nThe Qwikster Debacle (A Lesson in what not to do)# In 2011, Netflix attempted to split DVD and streaming into two services, resulting in a 60% price hike for dual-users.\nResult: 800,000 customers lost in 90 days; stock value dropped over $12 billion. Lesson: Radical business model transitions require extreme sensitivity to customer habits. Legal and Cost Differences# Feature DVD-by-Mail (Atoms) Streaming (Bits) Legal Basis First Sale Doctrine: Allows renting purchased physical discs without studio permission. Licensing: Requires negotiated contracts for every title; doctrine does not apply. Cost Structure Fixed Costs: Buy the DVD once, rent it many times. Marginal Costs: Licensing fees rise as the user base grows. Inventory The Long Tail: Near-limitless selection of niche titles. \u0026ldquo;Long-Enough\u0026rdquo; Tail: Curated selection based on budget and availability. \u0026gt; The Long Tail: The DVD model allowed Netflix to monetize niche content. Streaming licensing makes this harder to achieve.\n3. Content Strategy: Surviving the \u0026ldquo;Streaming Wars\u0026rdquo;# With 6 firms controlling 90% of U.S. media, suppliers have immense bargaining power.\nChallenges# Windowing: Content is locked in specific channels (theaters, premium cable) for set periods. Price Hikes: Licensing costs skyrocketed (e.g., Starz requested 10x their original fee for renewal). Exclusives: Competitors (Disney+, Peacock) pulled popular shows like The Office and Friends to anchor their own services. Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Solution# Originals: Investing billions in owned content (Stranger Things, Bridgerton) to escape licensing fees. Global Scale: Producing content in local languages (e.g., Squid Game from Korea, Money Heist from Spain) that travels globally. Ad-Supported Tier: Introduced to reduce churn and capture price-sensitive users (added 10M subs in 3 months in 2023). Note on Transfer Pricing: When a conglomerate like Comcast moves a show like The Office to its own streaming service (Peacock), it must still \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; itself a fee. This is an accounting and legal requirement known as transfer pricing.\n4. The Data Advantage# Netflix possesses a data asset that linear TV cannot match, allowing for hyper-personalization.\nCollaborative Filtering# Netflix uses algorithms to classify users into \u0026ldquo;taste doppelgangers\u0026rdquo; and creates over 76,000 micro-genres.\nRecommendation Dominance: 75–80% of views come from recommendations, not search. The \u0026ldquo;Moment of Truth\u0026rdquo;: Users spend only 1.8 seconds viewing a title card. Netflix A/B tests and customizes thumbnails to appeal to specific users (e.g., showing a comedy actor vs. a romance actor on the same movie poster). Data Ethics# Bias in AI: Users have noted that \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; algorithms sometimes generate thumbnails featuring Black actors for Black users, even if the actor has a minor role. This highlights the risk of unintended bias in machine learning.\n5. Technology \u0026amp; Infrastructure# Netflix focuses on software, not hardware, to maintain speed and reliability.\n1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)# Netflix runs its computing on the cloud of its competitor, Amazon.\nWhy? It allows Netflix to focus on proprietary algorithms rather than data center maintenance. Architecture: Uses a Microservices Architecture (700+ small programs) rather than a monolithic system. This ensures that if one feature breaks, the whole service doesn\u0026rsquo;t crash. 2. Open Connect (CDN)# While AWS handles the logic, Netflix handles the heavy video bandwidth themselves.\nOpen Connect: A proprietary Content Delivery Network. Netflix gives ISPs free \u0026ldquo;red pizza box\u0026rdquo; servers to cache content locally, reducing internet traffic congestion and speeding up load times. 6. Future \u0026amp; Competition# The market is saturated, leading to subscription fatigue.\nGaming: Netflix is investing in a \u0026ldquo;crawl, walk, run\u0026rdquo; strategy for games, though currently \u0026lt;1% of users play them. Sports: While rivals (Amazon, Apple) spend billions on live sports rights, Netflix focuses on sports docuseries (e.g., Drive to Survive) to avoid high licensing fees. The Rivals: Disney+: High brand loyalty but heavy losses. Amazon Prime: Bundles video with shipping; high spending power. Max (Warner Bros): Premium content (HBO), but struggled with rebranding. Summary Takeaway# Netflix\u0026rsquo;s dominance is not just about movies; it is about Scale (content budget), Data (personalization), and Technology (streaming infrastructure).\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/notes/semester-3/is-301/class-notes/chapter-6-moores-law-and-more/","title":"Chapter 6 Moore's Law and More","section":"Class Notes","content":" Moore’s Law: Chip performance per dollar doubles every eighteen months. Microprocessor: The part of the computer that executes the instructions of a computer program. Latency: In computing, latency means delay. Low-latency tasks have less delay, so they are faster. Random-access memory (RAM): The fast, chip-based volatile storage in a computing device. Volatile memory: Storage (such as RAM chips) that is wiped clean when power is cut off from a device. Nonvolatile memory: Storage that retains data even when powered down (such as flash memory, hard disc, or DVD storage). Flash memory: Nonvolatile, chip-based storage, often used in mobile phones, cameras, and MP3 players. Sometimes called flash RAM, flash memory is slower than conventional RAM but holds its charge even when the power goes out. Solid state electronics: Semiconductor-based devices. Solid state components often suffer fewer failures and require less energy than mechanical counterparts because they have no moving parts. RAM, flash memory, and microprocessors are solid state devices. Hard drives are not. SSD: Solid state drive- a chip based, novolatile storage device. Semiconductors: A substance such as silicon dioxide used inside most computer chips that is capable of enabling as well as inhibiting the flow of electricity. From a managerial perspective, when someone refers to semiconductors, they are talking about computer chips, and the semiconductor industry is the chip business. Optical fiber line: A high-speed glass or plastic-lined networking cable used in telecommunications. Price elasticity: The rate at which the demand for a product or service fluctuates with price change. Goods and services that are highly price elastic (e.g., most consumer electronics) see demand spike as prices drop, whereas goods and services that are less price elastic are less responsive to price change (think heart surgery). Internet of Things (IoT): A vision where low-cost sensors, processors, and communication are embedded into a wide array of products and our environment, allowing a vast network to collect data, analyze input, and automatically coordinate collective action. Fabs: Semiconductor fabrication facilities; the multibillion-dollar plants used to manufacture semiconductors. Silicon wafers: A thin, circular slice of material used to create semiconductor devices. Hundreds of chips may be etched on a single wafer, where they are eventually cut out for individual packaging. Multicore microprocessors: Microprocessors with two or more (typically lower power) calculating processor cores on the same piece of silicon. Supercomputers: Computers that are among the fastest of any in the world at the time of their introduction. Massively parallel: Computers designed with many microprocessors that work together, simultaneously, to solve problems. Grid computing: A type of computing that uses special software to enable several, often idle computers to work together on a common problem, as if they were a massively parallel supercomputer. Cluster computing: Connecting server computers via software and networking so that their resources can be used to collectively solve computing tasks. Software as a service (SaaS): A form of cloud computing where a firm subscribes to a third-party software and receives a service that is delivered online. Cloud computing: Replacing computing resources—either an organization’s or individual’s hardware or software—with services provided over the Internet. Server farms: A massive network of computer servers running software to coordinate their collective use. Server farms provide the infrastructure backbone to SaaS and hardware cloud efforts, as well as many large-scale Internet services. E-waste: Discarded, often obsolete technology; also known as electronic waste.

Why do large firms sometimes fail?: Large firms often do not see new technologies as adding value to their business, and therefore do not invest in the innovation. How can a firm recognize potentially disruptive technology?: Pay attention to the trajectory of fast and cheap technological advancement as well as new and emerging technology. It\u0026rsquo;s important to converse with those on the experimental edge of technology. Transition costs: Even for firms that are well armed for a battle with an emergent and disruptive newcomer, a transition from old models to new can be costly. Additive manufacturing: A type of industrial 3D printing where material is built up, layer by layer, as material is progressively added to shape an object. Bitcoin: An open source, decentralized payment system (sometimes controversially referred to as a digital, virtual, or cryptocurrency) that operates in a peer-to-peer environment, without bank or central authority. Cryptocurrency: A digital asset where a secure form of mathematics (cryptography) is used to handle transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies usually take advantage of a technology known as a blockchain. Blockchain: A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down. DeFi: A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down. CBDC: A digital form of a government-issued currency. Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to a currency or commodity, rather than have currency value float independently. Crypto benefits: It’s often thought that cryptocurrencies could be a boon for international commerce, especially for cross-border remittance and in expanding e-commerce in emerging markets. Consumer benefit: For cryptocurrencies, consumer benefit needs to be stronger.

It generates reliable profits, largely driven by AWS and advertising, rather than just retail margins. Scope: Amazon accounts for roughly 50% of every $1 spent on retail e-commerce. Third-Party Impact: Third-party sellers make up 60% of Amazon’s retail sales. Amazon handles logistics/fees for these sellers, often taking ~50% of the seller\u0026rsquo;s revenue. Employment: Amazon is the nation\u0026rsquo;s second-largest private employer (behind Walmart), having hired city-sized populations during the pandemic. Long-Term Strategy: Founder Jeff Bezos emphasized a 5-to-7-year investment horizon (vs. the standard 3-year corporate view), prioritizing long-term market leadership over short-term profits. 8.2 The Emperor of E-commerce: Strategy \u0026amp; Operations# Amazon’s competitive advantage is built on the \u0026ldquo;Wheel of Growth\u0026rdquo;: Selection, Customer Experience, and Low Prices.\nFulfillment \u0026amp; Robotics# Amazon’s warehouses are distinct from traditional retail distribution centers. They are designed for individual item picking rather than pallet shipping.\nRobotics: The acquisition of Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics) allows shelves to travel to workers. Robots like Proteus and Sparrow (robotic arms) utilize AI and computer vision to handle inventory. Efficiency: Robotics reduced fulfillment costs by ~40% and cut order processing time from 1.5 hours to as little as 15 minutes. Process: Random Stow: Dissimilar items are stored together to reduce picker error (e.g., lipstick next to jumper cables). SLAM: Scan, Label, Apply, Manifest machines automate packing. [Image of Amazon fulfillment center workflow]\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)# Amazon utilizes a Negative Cash Conversion Cycle, a massive financial advantage.\nDefinition: Amazon collects cash from customers weeks before it pays its suppliers. Result: This generates a massive pool of cash that can be reinvested into operations, cloud computing, or expansion without needing to borrow money. Comparison: Brick-and-mortar rivals (like Best Buy) often have positive CCCs, meaning their cash is tied up in inventory for weeks. Data \u0026amp; Personalization# A/B Testing: Amazon runs ~12,000 tests annually to optimize user experience. Ad Business: Amazon is the 3rd largest digital ad player (behind Google and Meta), leveraging user intent data for high-margin revenue ($38B+). Network Effects: The Amazon Marketplace creates a two-sided network effect—more buyers attract more sellers, and vice versa. The Long Tail: Amazon can profitably sell obscure items (the \u0026ldquo;tail\u0026rdquo; of the demand curve) that physical stores cannot stock due to shelf space limitations. 8.3 The Lord of Logistics# Amazon has vertically integrated its shipping to reduce costs and reliance on UPS/FedEx.\nScale: Amazon is now a larger shipper than FedEx or UPS. Assets: Prime Air: A fleet of 85+ cargo jets. Ocean Freight: Functions as a freight forwarder from China. Last Mile: Uses a network of \u0026ldquo;Same Day Sites,\u0026rdquo; electric Rivian vans, and \u0026ldquo;Amazon Flex\u0026rdquo; (Uber-style gig drivers). Innovation: Amazon Key: In-home or in-car delivery to prevent theft. Drones: continued testing of FAA-approved drone delivery for rapid fulfillment. 8.4 Reworking Brick-and-Mortar# Amazon has struggled with physical non-food retail (closing Amazon Books and 4-Star) but invests heavily in grocery and checkout tech.\n\u0026ldquo;Just Walk Out\u0026rdquo; Tech: Uses computer vision and sensors to eliminate checkout lines (Amazon Go). Grocery Strategy: Whole Foods: Acquired for $13.7B to gain a footprint in fresh food. Amazon Fresh: Mass-market grocery stores utilizing \u0026ldquo;Dash Carts\u0026rdquo; (smart carts that tally bills automatically). Biometrics: Amazon One allows payment via palm scanning, raising both convenience and privacy debates. 8.5 Consumer Electronics \u0026amp; Media# Amazon treats hardware as a service delivery mechanism, often selling devices at or below cost to drive ecosystem lock-in.\nProduct Strategy/Purpose Kindle Dominates eBooks (83% market share). Moves customers from \u0026ldquo;atoms to bits.\u0026rdquo; Fire TV/Tablets Low-cost entry to Prime Video and Amazon gaming. Alexa/Echo A platform for voice commerce and data gathering. Controls 70% of the smart speaker market but reportedly loses billions annually. Twitch Live streaming platform acquired for nearly $1B. Dominates gaming content and esports. Publishing Disruption: Amazon has disintermediated the publishing industry, allowing authors to self-publish (Kindle Direct Publishing) and creating its own imprints, causing channel conflict with traditional bookstores. 8.7 AI at Amazon# AI is integrated into every aspect of Amazon, from logistics prediction to customer-facing tools.\nAWS AI Services: Bedrock: Access to foundation models (Titan, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama) to build generative AI apps. Amazon Q: An enterprise-focused, secure chatbot assistant (ChatGPT rival). CodeWhisperer: AI coding companion for developers. Custom Silicon: Amazon designs its own AI chips—Trainium (for training models) and Inferentia (for running models)—to reduce reliance on expensive Nvidia hardware. Strategic Investment: Amazon invested heavily (up to $4B) in Anthropic (founded by OpenAI alumni) to bolster its AI model capabilities. 8.8 Regulatory Threats# Governments (US FTC and EU) are investigating Amazon for monopolistic practices.\nCore Allegations: Locking sellers into the ecosystem (forcing use of Amazon fulfillment). Artificially inflating prices by punishing sellers who offer lower prices elsewhere. Using third-party seller data to launch competing Amazon-branded products. Potential Outcome: While a breakup is discussed, regulator lawsuits often take years. Amazon argues its scale lowers prices for consumers. 8.9 Shopify: The Anti-Amazon# Shopify offers a platform for merchants to build independent online stores, rather than aggregating them into a single marketplace.\nModel: Subscription-based tools for branding, payments, and inventory. Heavily relies on Drop Shipping (shipping directly from manufacturer to consumer). Volatility: Shopify stock soared during the pandemic but crashed post-pandemic due to inflation and a return to physical retail. Current State: Shopify sold its logistics arm to focus on software, and recently partnered with Amazon to integrate \u0026ldquo;Buy with Prime\u0026rdquo; into Shopify stores, signaling a \u0026ldquo;coopetition\u0026rdquo; relationship.

Introduction to Python# Overview \u0026amp; Characteristics# [cite_start]General Purpose: Python is a general-purpose programming language used for various tasks, including search engines (Google), mission-critical projects (NASA), and financial transactions[cite: 129, 130]. [cite_start]Interpreted: Code is translated and executed by an interpreter one statement at a time, unlike compiled languages where the entire source code is compiled before execution[cite: 147, 148]. Object-Oriented: Data in Python are objects created from classes. [cite_start]A class defines properties and methods for manipulating objects[cite: 156]. [cite_start]History: Created by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands in 1990 and is Open Source[cite: 160, 161]. Python 2 vs. Python 3# [cite_start]Version Compatibility: Python 3 is a newer version and is not backward compatible with Python 2[cite: 167]. [cite_start]Course Standard: This course uses Python 3, though differences are minimal[cite: 174, 177]. Syntax Difference Example: [cite_start]Python 2: print \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;[cite: 178]. [cite_start]Python 3: print(\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;)[cite: 178]. II. Programming Modes# 1. Interactive Mode# [cite_start]Execution: Uses the Command Prompt or Shell to type python[cite: 8]. Limitations: [cite_start]Not suitable for large programs[cite: 25]. [cite_start]Does not save statements; code cannot be reused in the future without retyping[cite: 26, 27]. [cite_start]Editing code is tedious as you must revisit previous commands[cite: 28, 29]. 2. Script Mode# [cite_start]Execution: Code is written in a file (e.g., using Notepad), saved with a .py extension, and executed via the command line[cite: 34, 40, 46]. [cite_start]Benefits: Allows for saving, editing, and running larger blocks of code [cite: 36-40]. III. Program Structure \u0026amp; Anatomy# Basic Anatomy# [cite_start]Statements: Represents an action or a sequence of actions (e.g., print(\u0026quot;Welcome\u0026quot;))[cite: 288, 342]. Indentation: Indentation matters in Python. [cite_start]Statements must be entered from the first column or consistently indented (typically 4 spaces)[cite: 290, 350, 382]. [cite_start]Note: Incorrect indentation will cause an error[cite: 352]. Comments: [cite_start]Used to document code, describe sequences, or temporarily disable lines [cite: 484-486]. Single Line: Starts with #. [cite_start]Anything after # is ignored by Python[cite: 305, 482]. [cite_start]Paragraph/Block: Enclosed in triple quotes \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; or '''[cite: 360]. Planning with Pseudocode# [cite_start]Definition: A method of planning that enables the programmer to plan without worrying about syntax[cite: 81]. [cite_start]Sequence: Based on the assumption that the computer executes the program from the beginning to the end (SEQUENCE)[cite: 57, 59]. [cite_start]Process: Think about the goal, run through the steps, and write them in simple English before typing the program[cite: 65, 66]. IV. Variables \u0026amp; Identifiers# Variables# [cite_start]Definition: A named place in memory where a programmer can store data and retrieve it later[cite: 521]. Assignment: Uses the = operator. [cite_start]The expression on the right is evaluated and assigned to the variable on the left[cite: 573, 574]. [cite_start]Example: radius = 20[cite: 419]. [cite_start]Simultaneous assignment is possible: x, y = y, x[cite: 615]. Named Constants: Python has no special syntax for constants. [cite_start]By convention, use all uppercase letters to denote a constant (e.g., PI = 3.14)[cite: 623, 624]. Identifier Rules# [cite_start]Allowed Characters: Letters, digits, underscores (_), and asterisks (*)[cite: 491]. Starting Character: Must start with a letter or an underscore. [cite_start]Cannot start with a digit[cite: 492]. [cite_start]Case Sensitivity: Python is case sensitive (e.g., spam, Spam, and SPAM are different)[cite: 502, 506]. [cite_start]Reserved Words: Identifiers cannot be reserved words (keywords like if, while, class, import, return, etc.)[cite: 493, 513]. V. Data Types \u0026amp; Math# Numerical Data Types# [cite_start]Integer (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 3, -14, 0)[cite: 630, 639]. [cite_start]Float (float): Numbers with decimal parts (e.g., 3.0, 98.6, -2.5)[cite: 631, 640]. [cite_start]Scientific Notation: Floating-point literals can use e or E for exponents[cite: 678, 681]. [cite_start]Example: 1.23456e+2 is equivalent to 123.456[cite: 679].

Decision Structures# Introduction to Decisions# [cite_start]Control Structures: While programs normally follow a sequential flow, control structures allow the program to alter this flow to suit specific situations [cite: 830-832]. [cite_start]Decision Structure: Also known as a \u0026ldquo;selection structure,\u0026rdquo; this allows a program to execute different sequences of instructions for different cases[cite: 839, 884]. The if Statement# Syntax: if condition: statement statement Logic: [cite_start]The condition is evaluated first[cite: 865]. [cite_start]If True: The indented statements are executed[cite: 867]. [cite_start]If False: The statements are skipped[cite: 868]. [Image of if statement flowchart]\nRelational Operators# Relational operators determine the relationship between two values.\nOperator Mathematics Meaning Citation \u0026lt; $\u0026lt;$ [cite_start]Less than [cite: 964] \u0026lt;= $\\le$ [cite_start]Less than or equal to [cite: 964] == $=$ [cite_start]Equal to [cite: 964] \u0026gt;= $\\ge$ [cite_start]Greater than or equal to [cite: 964] \u0026gt; $\u0026gt;$ [cite_start]Greater than [cite: 964] != $\\ne$ [cite_start]Not equal to [cite: 964] [cite_start]Warning: Do not confuse the equality operator == with the assignment operator =[cite: 1009]. Boolean Expressions \u0026amp; Variables# [cite_start]Boolean Expressions: Expressions tested by if statements that evaluate to either True or False[cite: 934, 1031]. [cite_start]Flags: A boolean variable used to signal when a specific condition exists in a program[cite: 947]. Comparing Strings# [cite_start]Method: Strings are compared character by character based on their ASCII/Unicode values (lexicographic ordering)[cite: 1016, 1143]. [cite_start]Case Sensitivity: Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Bbbb\u0026rdquo; comes before \u0026ldquo;aaaa\u0026rdquo;)[cite: 1017]. II. Advanced Decision Logic# The if-else Statement (Two-Way)# [cite_start]Purpose: A dual alternative decision structure that provides two possible paths of execution[cite: 1095]. Syntax: if condition: statements else: other statements[cite_start][cite: 1097-1100] [Image of if-else statement flowchart]\nThe if-elif-else Statement (Multi-Way)# Purpose: Allows for testing multiple conditions in order. [cite_start]It executes the block for the first true condition found and ignores the rest [cite: 1231-1232]. [cite_start]Mutually Exclusive: This structure sets up mutually exclusive code blocks[cite: 1230]. [cite_start]Optional Else: The else block is optional; without it, it is possible no indented block will execute[cite: 1240]. Nested Decision Structures# [cite_start]Definition: A decision structure placed inside another decision structure[cite: 1248]. [cite_start]Usage: Commonly used when multiple criteria must be met (e.g., salary \u0026gt; 30k and years on job \u0026gt;= 2)[cite: 1251]. [cite_start]Formatting: Proper indentation is crucial for the interpreter and readability[cite: 1274]. Logical Operators# [cite_start]Operators used to combine boolean expressions[cite: 1332].\n[cite_start]and: True only if both operands are true[cite: 1341]. [cite_start]or: True if either operand is true[cite: 1348]. [cite_start]not: Reverses the logical value (True becomes False, False becomes True)[cite: 1362]. Short-Circuit Evaluation: For or: If the left operand is true, the rest is ignored (result is true). [cite_start]For and: If the left operand is false, the rest is ignored (result is false) [cite: 1354-1356]. Checking Ranges: [cite_start]Inside range: x \u0026gt;= 10 and x \u0026lt;= 20[cite: 1370]. [cite_start]Outside range: x \u0026lt; 10 or x \u0026gt; 20[cite: 1372]. III. Repetition Structures# The while Loop (Condition-Controlled)# [cite_start]Behavior: Repeats a set of statements as long as a condition is true[cite: 1402]. Pretest Loop: The condition is tested before the iteration. [cite_start]If false initially, the loop never runs [cite: 1425-1426]. Infinite Loops: Occur if the loop does not contain code to make the condition false. [cite_start]The loop repeats until interrupted [cite: 1453-1454]. [Image of while loop flowchart]\nThe for Loop (Count-Controlled)# [cite_start]Behavior: Iterates a specific number of times, typically over a sequence of data items [cite: 1462-1464]. [cite_start]Syntax: for variable in [val1, val2]:[cite: 1467]. [cite_start]Target Variable: References the current item in the sequence during each iteration[cite: 1501]. [cite_start]The range() Function: Simplifies creating iterable sequences[cite: 1490]. One argument: range(stop) Two arguments: range(start, stop) [cite_start]Three arguments: range(start, stop, step) [cite: 1493-1496]. [cite_start]Descending: Use a negative step value, e.g., range(10, 0, -1)[cite: 1519]. IV. Common Loop Patterns# Calculating a Running Total# [cite_start]Accumulator: A variable initialized to 0 outside the loop to store the total[cite: 1527]. [cite_start]Process: The loop reads each number and adds it to the accumulator[cite: 1526, 1539]. Augmented Assignment Operators# [cite_start]Shorthand operators for updating variables[cite: 1547].\nOperator Usage Equivalent To Citation += c += 3 [cite_start]c = c + 3 [cite: 1572] -= y -= 2 [cite_start]y = y - 2 [cite: 1565] *= z *= 10 [cite_start]z = z * 10 [cite: 1566] /= a /= b [cite_start]a = a / b [cite: 1567] Sentinels# [cite_start]Definition: A special value marking the end of a sequence (e.g., an empty string or -1)[cite: 1583]. [cite_start]Requirement: Must be distinctive enough not to be mistaken for actual data[cite: 1585]. Input Validation Loops# Concept: \u0026ldquo;Garbage in, garbage out\u0026rdquo; (GIGO). [cite_start]Programs should reject bad input [cite: 1593-1594]. [cite_start]Logic: Use a while loop that repeats as long as the input is invalid, prompting the user again[cite: 1601]. Nested Loops# [cite_start]Definition: A loop contained inside another loop[cite: 1620]. [cite_start]Execution: The inner loop completes all its iterations for each single iteration of the outer loop[cite: 1653]. [cite_start]Total Iterations: Iterations of inner loop × Iterations of outer loop[cite: 1656].

Functions# Introduction to Functions# Definition: A group of statements within a program that performs a specific task. [cite_start]Divide and Conquer: A strategy of breaking a large, complex program into smaller, modularized tasks (functions) [cite: 1012-1016]. Benefits: Simpler code. Code Reuse: Write once, call multiple times. Better testing and debugging (test individually). [cite_start]Faster development and facilitation of teamwork [cite: 1073-1079]. Types of Functions# [cite_start]Void Functions: Execute statements and terminate (do not return a value) [cite: 1087-1089]. [cite_start]Value-Returning Functions: Execute statements and return a value to the calling statement (e.g., int(), input()) [cite: 1090-1092]. Defining and Calling# [cite_start]Naming Rules: Cannot use keywords, cannot contain spaces, must start with a letter or underscore, and are case-sensitive [cite: 1100-1103]. Syntax: def function_name(): statement statement [cite_start]Indentation: The block of statements belonging to the function must be indented consistently [cite: 1143-1144]. [cite_start]Main Function: Defines the mainline logic of the program and calls other functions as needed [cite: 1135-1137]. Designing with Functions# [cite_start]Flowcharts: Function calls are depicted as rectangles with vertical bars at each side[cite: 1153]. [cite_start]Hierarchy Charts: (Structure Charts) Depict relationships between functions using boxes and connecting lines to show what calls what [cite: 1173-1174]. [cite_start]The pass Keyword: Can be used to create empty functions as placeholders during design[cite: 1195]. Variables and Scope# Local Variables: Created inside a function and belong only to that function. [cite_start]They cannot be accessed by code outside the function [cite: 1205-1207]. Scope: The part of the program where a variable may be accessed. Global Variables: Created outside all functions. Accessible anywhere but make debugging difficult and programs hard to understand. [cite_start]Avoid usage [cite: 1340, 1348-1353]. Global Constants: Global names referencing unchangeable values. [cite_start]These are permissible[cite: 1358]. Arguments and Parameters# Argument: Data sent into a function call. [cite_start]Parameter: The variable inside the function that receives the argument[cite: 1243]. [cite_start]Pass by Value: Changes made to a parameter inside the function do not affect the argument outside the function [cite: 1287-1288]. [cite_start]Keyword Arguments: Specifies which parameter a value belongs to (e.g., func(parameter=value)), allowing arguments to be passed out of order [cite: 1331-1332]. Return Values# Syntax: return expression. Multiple Values: Python can return multiple values separated by commas. [cite_start]Example: return expression1, expression2 [cite: 1527-1528]. [cite_start]None: A special value meaning \u0026ldquo;no value,\u0026rdquo; often used to indicate errors [cite: 1533-1534]. II. Modules and Standard Library# Standard Library# Definition: Pre-written functions that come with Python (e.g., print, range). Modules: Files that store library functions. [cite_start]To use them, you must use the import statement [cite: 1386-1389]. The random Module# Requires import random. Useful functions include:\n[cite_start]randint(min, max): Returns a random integer in the range[cite: 1414]. randrange(start, stop, step): Returns a randomly selected integer from the sequence. random(): Returns a float between 0.0 and 1.0. [cite_start]uniform(min, max): Returns a float within a specified range [cite: 1442-1447]. Seeds: random.seed() initializes the random number generator. [cite_start]By default, it uses system time [cite: 1454-1456]. The math Module# Requires import math.\nFunction Description Citation ceil(x) [cite_start]Smallest integer \u0026gt;= x [cite: 1554] floor(x) [cite_start]Largest integer \u0026lt;= x [cite: 1554] sqrt(x) [cite_start]Square root of x [cite: 1554] pow(x, y) x raised to power of y pi [cite_start]Constant value of $\\pi$ [cite: 1559] Creating Modules# Any file ending in .py can be imported as a module. Conditional Execution: To prevent code from running when imported, use: if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main()[cite_start]This ensures main() only runs if the file is executed as a standalone program [cite: 1610-1611]. III. Files and File Input/Output# Basics of File I/O# Purpose: To retain data between program runs (save to disk). Types of Files: Text: Encoded as text. [cite_start]Binary: Raw data not converted to text [cite: 1724-1725]. Access Methods: Sequential: Read from beginning to end (e.g., tape). [cite_start]Direct: Jump to any piece of data [cite: 1727-1728]. File Operations# Open: Creates a file object. file_variable = open(filename, mode). Process: Read or write data. Close: Disconnects the program from the file. [cite_start]file_variable.close() [cite: 1700-1703]. File Modes# 'r': Read only. 'w': Write. Overwrites existing file or creates a new one. 'a': Append. [cite_start]Adds to the end of the file or creates a new one[cite: 1757, 1799]. Reading and Writing# Writing: file.write(string). [cite_start]Note: You usually need to concatenate a newline \\n to the string[cite: 1773, 1790]. [cite_start]Numeric Data: Must be converted to string (str()) before writing[cite: 1809]. Reading: read(): Reads entire file into memory. readline(): Reads a single line (including \\n). [cite_start]rstrip(): Removes specific characters (like \\n) from the end of a string [cite: 1780-1783, 1792]. [cite_start]Numeric Data: Must be converted to int or float after reading[cite: 1812]. Processing Files with Loops# While Loop: Use readline and check for an empty string (end of file sentinel). while line != \u0026#39;\u0026#39;: # process[cite_start][cite: 1821-1822] For Loop: Python automatically iterates over lines in a file. for line in file_object: statements[cite_start][cite: 1844]. IV. Exceptions# Concepts# [cite_start]Exception: An error that occurs during runtime (e.g., division by zero, file not found) that typically crashes the program[cite: 1871]. [cite_start]Traceback: The error message indicating where the error occurred[cite: 1872]. Exception Handling (try / except)# Used to prevent crashes by handling errors gracefully.\nTry Suite: Statements that might cause an exception. Except Clause: Code that executes if a specific exception occurs. [cite_start]Else Clause (Optional): Executes only if no exception was raised[cite: 1934]. [cite_start]Finally Clause (Optional): Executes always, regardless of exceptions (used for cleanup) [cite: 1946-1947]. Syntax:\ntry: statements except ValueError: print(\u0026#34;Invalid number\u0026#34;) except IOError as err: [cite_start]print(err) # Prints default error message [cite: 1925] else: print(\u0026#34;Success\u0026#34;) finally: print(\u0026#34;Cleanup\u0026#34;)"},{"id":34,"href":"/notes/semester-3/is-310/weekly-notes/week-4-data-structures/","title":"Week 4 Data Structures","section":"Weekly notes","content":"I. Sequences and Lists# Sequences# Definition: An object that contains multiple items of data stored one after another. [cite_start]Types: Python provides different types of sequences, mainly lists (mutable) and tuples (immutable) [cite: 715-717]. Lists# Definition: A mutable object that contains multiple data items (elements). Format: list = [item1, item2, etc.]. Characteristics: [cite_start]Can hold items of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats) [cite: 722-725]. print() can display the entire list. list() function converts other objects to lists. List Operations# Repetition Operator (*): Creates multiple copies of a list joined together. [cite_start]Format: list * n [cite: 749-752]. Iteration: You can iterate over a list using a for loop: for item in list: # process item Indexing: Position of an element (starting at 0). [cite_start]Negative indexes count from the end (-1 is the last element) [cite: 760-763]. len(list) returns the number of elements. [cite_start]Mutability: Elements can be changed using their index: list[1] = new_value [cite: 779-781]. [cite_start]Concatenation (+): Joins two lists together [cite: 787-788]. [cite_start]Slicing: Extracts a span of items: list[start : end] [cite: 795-797]. List Methods \u0026amp; Built-in Functions# Method/Function Description Citation append(item) Adds item to the end of the list. [cite_start] [cite: 816, 838, 845] index(item) Returns the index of the first occurrence of item. [cite_start] [cite: 817-818, 839, 846] insert(index, item) Inserts item at a specific position. [cite_start] [cite: 825, 840, 848] sort() Sorts list in ascending order. [cite_start] [cite: 827, 841, 853] remove(item) Removes the first occurrence of item. [cite_start] [cite: 828, 842, 854] reverse() Reverses the order of elements. [cite_start] [cite: 829, 843, 855] del list[i] Removes element at specific index. [cite_start] [cite: 860-861] min() / max() Returns lowest/highest value in the sequence. [cite_start] [cite: 862] Copying Lists# Reference vs. Value: list1 = list2 only makes list1 reference the same object as list2 (modifying one affects the other). True Copy: Create a new list and copy elements: Create empty list and append loop. [cite_start]Concatenate existing list to a new empty list (new_list = [] + old_list) [cite: 870-873]. II. Advanced List Features# List Comprehensions# Definition: A concise expression to create a new list by iterating over an existing one. [cite_start]Basic Syntax: [item for item in old_list][cite: 909, 928]. [cite_start]Calculations: [item**2 for item in list] creates a list of squares[cite: 943]. [cite_start]Filtering (if clause): [item for item in list if item \u0026lt; 10] includes only items meeting criteria[cite: 964, 971]. Two-Dimensional Lists# Definition: A list containing other lists as elements (nested list), often representing rows and columns. [cite_start]Processing: Typically requires nested loops to process data (two indexes needed) [cite: 977, 981-982]. III. Tuples# Definition: An immutable sequence (cannot be changed once created). Format: tuple_name = (item1, item2). Operations: Supports indexing, slicing, len(), min(), max(), and in operator. Limitations: Does not support append, remove, insert, reverse, or sort. [cite_start]Advantages: Faster processing than lists and safer (data cannot be accidentally modified) [cite: 1010-1015, 1025-1030, 1037-1038]. IV. Plotting with matplotlib# [cite_start]Installation: Not standard; install via pip install matplotlib[cite: 1056]. [cite_start]Import: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt[cite: 1075]. Line Graph: plt.plot(x_coords, y_coords) connects points. Bar Chart: plt.bar(left_edges, heights, bar_width, color). Pie Chart: plt.pie(values, labels=slice_labels). [cite_start]Display: plt.show() renders the graph [cite: 1081, 1257, 1361-1362]. V. Dictionaries# Introduction# Definition: An object that stores a collection of data as key-value pairs (mappings). Format: dictionary = {key1: val1, key2: val2}. Keys: Must be immutable objects (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). Retrieval: dictionary[key]. [cite_start]Raises KeyError if key is not found [cite: 1409-1416, 1425-1426]. Operations# Adding/Modifying: dictionary[key] = value. [cite_start]If key exists, value is updated; otherwise, new pair is added [cite: 1436-1437]. Deleting: del dictionary[key]. [cite_start]Length: len(dictionary) returns number of pairs[cite: 1443, 1450]. Methods: clear(): Empties the dictionary. get(key, default): Safely retrieves value without KeyError. items(): Returns all keys and values as tuples. keys(): Returns all keys. values(): Returns all values. [cite_start]pop(key): Returns value and removes pair [cite: 1468-1471, 1479, 1490-1491]. Dictionary Comprehensions# Syntax: {item: item**2 for item in list}. [cite_start]Creates a dictionary from a sequence [cite: 1516-1517, 1539]. VI. Sets# Introduction# Definition: An unordered collection of unique elements (no duplicates allowed). Creation: set_variable = set(argument). Argument must be iterable. Mutability: Sets are mutable; elements can be added/removed. Set Operations# Adding: add(item) or update(sequence). Removing: remove(item) (raises error if missing) or discard(item) (no error). Set Math: Union (|): Contains all elements from both sets. Intersection (\u0026amp;): Contains only elements found in both sets. Difference (-): Elements in the first set but not the second. [cite_start]Symmetric Difference (^): Elements in either set, but not both [cite: 1613-1614, 1620-1623, 1641-1646, 1653-1658, 1675-1681]. [cite_start]Subsets/Supersets: issubset (\u0026lt;=) and issuperset (\u0026gt;=) [cite: 1687-1691]. VII. Serializing Objects# Definition: Converting an object to a stream of bytes to store in a file (Pickling). Process: import pickle Open file for binary writing ('wb'). Pickle: pickle.dump(object, file). [cite_start]Unpickle: pickle.load(file) (requires opening file for binary reading 'rb') [cite: 1749-1750, 1759-1763, 1768-1773].

Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)# Procedural vs. Object-Oriented# Procedural Programming: Writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks. [cite_start]Procedures operate on data items that are separate from the procedures [cite: 2680-2681]. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Focuses on creating objects. [cite_start]An object is an entity that contains both data (attributes) and procedures (methods) [cite: 2689-2690]. Core OOP Concepts# [cite_start]Encapsulation: Combining data and code into a single object[cite: 2693]. Data Hiding: An object\u0026rsquo;s attributes are hidden from code outside the object. [cite_start]Access is restricted to the object\u0026rsquo;s methods to protect from accidental corruption [cite: 2706-2708]. [cite_start]Object Reusability: The same object can be used in different programs[cite: 2710]. Classes vs. Instances# Class: Code that specifies the data attributes and methods for a type of object. [cite_start]It acts as a blueprint or cookie cutter [cite: 2733-2734]. [cite_start]Instance: A specific object created from a class (e.g., a specific house built from the blueprint)[cite: 2735]. Defining Classes# Syntax: class ClassName: def method(self): # statements The self Parameter: Required in every method. [cite_start]It references the specific object instance the method is working on[cite: 2771]. The __init__ Method: Also known as the initializer. It is automatically executed when an instance is created to initialize attributes [cite: 2777-2778]. Creating Instances: my_instance = ClassName()[cite_start][cite: 2803]. Attributes and Methods# [cite_start]Hiding Attributes: To make an attribute private, place two underscores before the name (e.g., __current_minute)[cite: 2813]. Accessor Methods (Getters): Return a value from an attribute without changing it[cite: 2882]. [cite_start]Mutator Methods (Setters): Store or change the value of an attribute[cite: 2883]. The __str__ Method: Returns the object\u0026rsquo;s state as a string. Automatically called when the object is passed to print() [cite: 2834-2835]. Class Design (UML)# UML Diagram: Unified Modeling Language. Depicted as a box with three sections: Class Name Data Attributes [cite_start]Methods [cite: 2896, 2898-2901]. Finding Classes: Look for nouns in the problem description. [cite_start]Refine the list by removing nouns that represent simple values or duplicates [cite: 2926-2929, 2954-2957]. II. Inheritance# Concepts# \u0026ldquo;Is a\u0026rdquo; Relationship: Exists when a specialized object has all characteristics of a general object plus specialized ones (e.g., A poodle is a dog; a car is a vehicle) [cite: 3000-3003]. Inheritance: Defines a new class that borrows behavior from another class. Superclass: The general class being borrowed from. [cite_start]Subclass: The new specialized class doing the borrowing [cite: 3015-3016]. Benefits# [cite_start]Avoids Duplication: Common methods (e.g., homeAddress) are defined once in the superclass[cite: 3041]. [cite_start]Code Reuse: New classes are based on existing ones[cite: 3043]. Syntax Example# class Parent: def func1(self): print(\u0026#34;Hello Parent\u0026#34;) class Child(Parent): # Inherits from Parent def func2(self): print(\u0026#34;Hello Child\u0026#34;)"},{"id":36,"href":"/notes/semester-3/is-310/weekly-notes/week-6-python-libraries/","title":"Week 6 Python Libraries","section":"Weekly notes","content":"I. Introduction to Libraries# What is a Library?# Definition: A collection of pre-combined codes used iteratively to reduce coding time. [cite_start]It allows access to pre-written, frequently used code instead of writing from scratch [cite: 2271-2272]. Concept: Similar to physical libraries, they are a collection of reusable resources. [cite_start]This concept is the foundation of open-source libraries in Python [cite: 2273-2274]. [cite_start]Purpose: They extend the capabilities of the language by providing tools and modules for specific tasks [cite: 2282-2283]. Benefits of Using Libraries# Reduced coding time and effort. Improved code quality and reliability. Increased readability and maintainability. [cite_start]Access to a wide range of functionality and reduced development costs [cite: 2336-2340]. Structure of a Python Library# A library is typically structured as a directory containing:\n[cite_start]__init__.py: Files that tell Python the directory is a package[cite: 2299]. Modules: Python files (e.g., clean_data.py, load_data.py) containing the actual code. [cite_start]README.md: A markdown file containing documentation for the library[cite: 2301]. II. Standard vs. External Libraries# Python Standard Libraries# [cite_start]Python comes with a robust set of standard libraries for various tasks [cite: 2307-2333]:\nMath/Numbers: math, random, statistics. File System/OS: os, os.path, fileinput, platform, io. Data Types: collections, array. Text Processing: string, re (Regular Expressions). Data Handling: csv, gzip, zipfile. Time: datetime, calendar. Important External Libraries# [cite_start]There are numerous powerful open-source libraries available for advanced tasks [cite: 2353-2365]:\nMachine Learning/AI: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch. Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib. Computer Vision/NLP: OpenCV, spaCy, NLTK. III. Deep Dive: Library Examples \u0026amp; Use Cases# 1. scikit-learn (sklearn)# [cite_start]Description: A free, open-source machine learning library built upon NumPy and SciPy [cite: 4616-4617]. Core Functions: [cite_start]Classification: Identifying which category an object belongs to (e.g., Spam detection) [cite: 4618-4619]. [cite_start]Regression: Predicting a continuous-valued attribute (e.g., Stock prices) [cite: 4621-4622]. [cite_start]Clustering: Automatic grouping of similar objects (e.g., Customer segmentation) [cite: 4626-4627]. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Image Recognition (e.g., an E-commerce app searching apparel by image)[cite: 4636, 4645]. 2. Keras# Description: A high-level neural networks API designed for fast experimentation with Deep Learning. [cite_start]It focuses on user-friendliness and modularity[cite: 4651]. [cite_start]Benefit: Makes it easy to define and train neural networks without worrying about underlying implementation details[cite: 4652]. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Object Detection (e.g., identifying suspicious items or vehicles)[cite: 4662, 4669]. 3. Pandas# [cite_start]Description: An open-source library built on top of Python specifically for data manipulation and analysis[cite: 4676]. [cite_start]Dependencies: Built on top of Matplotlib (for visualization) and NumPy (for math)[cite: 4679]. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Data Analytics and Anomaly Detection (e.g., identifying unauthorized access)[cite: 4684, 4691]. 4. Matplotlib# [cite_start]Description: A comprehensive plotting library for Python and NumPy[cite: 4697]. [cite_start]Purpose: Used by scientists and analysts to create plots and visualizations to communicate findings effectively[cite: 4698]. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Data Visualization (e.g., Building dynamic plots for trackers like a Covid-19 tracker)[cite: 4702, 4727]. 5. spaCy# [cite_start]Description: A library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), written in Cython and Python[cite: 4731]. Capabilities: [cite_start]Part-of-speech tagging (identifying Nouns, Verbs, etc.)[cite: 4734]. [cite_start]Named Entity Recognition (People, Places, Amounts)[cite: 4735]. [cite_start]Information Extraction[cite: 4736]. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Sentiment Analysis (e.g., evaluating human emotions associated with a product)[cite: 4742, 4780]. 6. OpenCV# Description: \u0026ldquo;Open Source Computer Vision Library.\u0026rdquo; [cite_start]Contains hundreds of computer vision algorithms[cite: 4785]. Applications: Facial recognition, object detection, and image processing. [cite_start]Example Use Case: Facial Recognition (e.g., identifying unauthorized persons)[cite: 4796, 4802].

The Trojan war This war took place approx 4 years before the piece was written We start in the middle of the war Talks of the flood-almost like in Gilgamesh Couple spared in the flood and tasked with repopulating the earth through throwing stones (the bones of the earth) Troy is the western coast of Turkey Several layers have been excavated in this region discovering cities (9) Some evidence of war in this region from excavations The Hittite kingdom was located near the East of the Troy - can easily make cultural references/connection The Trojan war is started by the Judgement of Paris in which he chooses Aphrodite for love over two other Goddesses, Athena and Hera/ Paris seduced Helen, wife of Spartan Lord Menelaus. Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother Agamemnon. The content of the poem centers around Achilles, the greatest warrior of Agamemnon\u0026rsquo;s forces Angered the god Apollo by kidnapping Chryseis- the daughter of the high priest Chryses Forced to give up this woman, Agamemnon takes Achilles concubine Briseis in return, angering Achilles and provoking the warrior to “sit out” the war.

Note the **hospitality **of Telemachus to the disguised goddess; hospitality is a significant theme in this text, so obsessed with feasting! Notice the contrast between Telemachus and the suitors. Notice too how the bard Phemius performs a song of Achaeans returning from Troy (but Penelope stops him from singing that \u0026ldquo;painful song\u0026rdquo; (1.276). Odysseus is a poor young man Hospitality is a central theme of the text and the culture as a whole The idea that when aiding a stranger, you actually might be aiding a god or gods in disguise- you may be rewarded for your actions- so be kind Telemachus is angry with all the suitors- Athena advises Telemachus to sail off and seek the word of his father (King Nestor in Pylos and the to Menelaus in Sparta) “\u0026ldquo;If you think it\u0026rsquo;s better and would prefer / that one man\u0026rsquo;s livelihood should be consumed / without paying anything, I\u0026rsquo;ll call on / the immortal gods to see if mighty Zeus / will bring about an act of retribution\u0026rdquo; (1.319-23)” \u0026ldquo;Telemachus spoke, then threw the scepter on the ground / and burst out crying\u0026rdquo; (2.52-53). Wily Penelope quote about the suitors- sounds similar to her husband Odysseus \u0026ldquo;you [suitors] must wait, / although you are keen for me to marry, / till I complete this cloak—for if I don\u0026rsquo;t, / my weaving would be wasted and in vain\u0026rdquo; (2.74-77) [but, after four years, she is betrayed by one of her women] Female characters are shown throughout the text weaving (including Athena)- a metaphor for how the narrative of the story is being shaped and spun over time Betrayed by a female servant who thus ends her resistance to the suitors (cant stop them) Athena roams Ithaca in disguise as Telemachus to recruit sailors for him in order to ensure that he is able to depart in a swift manner In Book 3 (omitted from your books), Telemachus will sail to Peleponnese (southern Greece) and journey by land to the city of Pylos where he will be entertained by his father\u0026rsquo;s old comrade, King Nestor. The King offers his own account of the battles at Troy and his return home to Pylos. The King will send Telemachus on, further, to Sparta to see Menelaus. Nestor\u0026rsquo;s son, Pisistratus (same name as later Athenian ruler) will accompany Telemachus. Telemachus compares the Hall of Menelaus to Zeus’s kingdom- and is corrected by Minnelaus: \u0026ldquo;No man alive could rival Zeus, dear boys, / with his everlasting palace and possessions\u0026rdquo; (4.87-88). Meleanus grieves for Odyseus and recognizes Telemachus by his resemblance to his father Helen\u0026rsquo;s and Menelaus\u0026rsquo; account of Odysseus sneaking into Troy as a beggar and, then, the Trojan Horse: \u0026ldquo;We heard you [Helen] call. / Two of us—Diomedes and myself—were eager to get up and charge outside / or else to answer back from where we sat, in side the horse. But Odysseus stopped us—/we wished to speak, but he held us in check\u0026rdquo; (4.86-90) Helen admits that she might have been drugged in Troy We are reminded of the characters own mortality Athena appeals to the gods to aid Odysseus, who is still trapped on the island with Calypso and has been for 7 years. Athena describes the ambush that is being set for Telemachus. Hermes goes to Calypso to tell her that Odysseus must leave the island. Further establishes the theme of mortality vs immortality Odysseus sits regularly by the sea \u0026ldquo;his eyes always full of tears / because he was squandering his sweet life, mourning / for his return\u0026rdquo; (5.100-103).\nOdysseus is Desperate for immortality\nMonsters stand at the threshold of becoming \u0026ldquo;Monsters ask us how we perceive our world and \u0026ldquo;how we have misrepresented what we have attempted to place.\u0026rdquo; Odysseus starts to embrace his humanity and mortality Odysseus has to leave the island and must build his own boat in order to leave it Reminded of what it means to be a mortal in the realm of the gods However, Poseidon (Sea god) makes his journey difficult and Odysseus ends up washed up on the the shores of Paheacia \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s trouble! In this country I have reached, what are the people like? Are they violent and untamed, without a sense of justice? Or are they kind to strangers? In their minds do they fear the gods?” Book 7: Odysseus appears with the queen of the Phoenicians, Arete, and her husband King Alcinous Oyssedeus asks for kindness from the queen Another example of hospitality and sanctuary Alcinous: \u0026ldquo;If he\u0026rsquo;s a deathless one come down from heaven, / then gods are planning something different. / So far they\u0026rsquo;ve always shown themselves to us / in their true form\u0026rdquo; (7.78-80) They think that Ossyedus may have been sent from the gods However, Odysseus explains that he is mortal and not a god “I’m like mortal men. Indeed, I could recount a longer story, all those hardships I have had to suffer.” (To Alcinous) \u0026ldquo;After they enjoyed their heart\u0026rsquo;s fill of food and drink, the minstrel Demodocus, inspired by the Muse, sang about the glorious deeds of warriors, that story, whose fame had climbed to spacious heaven, about Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus, when, at a lavish feat in honor of the gods, they fought each other in ferocious argument\u0026rdquo; (8.34-40) Get a glimpse into the Greek Culture Another feast occurs between Aphrodite and and Ares which Hephaestus (Vulcan) learns about and is embarrassed and angry “\u0026ldquo;Nasty deeds don\u0026rsquo;t pay. / The slow one overtakes the swift just as / Hephaestus, slow as he is, has caught Ares, / although of all gods who hold Olympus / he\u0026rsquo;s the fastest one there is. Yes, he\u0026rsquo;s lame, / but he\u0026rsquo;s a crafty one\u0026rdquo; (124-29). The tortoise and the hare type of situation \u0026ldquo;He sang about the various ways those warriors / laid waste that lofty town [Troy] and how Odysseus, / like Ares, god of war, and noble Menelaus / went to the home of Deiphobus [Trojan prince], where, he said / Odysseus battled in the most horrendous fight, / from which he then emerged at last victorious\u0026rdquo; (8.249-54) Omitted text from my edition: \u0026ldquo;That was the song the famous harper sang / but great Odysseus melted into tears, / \u0026hellip; / as a woman weeps, her arms flung around her darling husband, / a man who fell in battle, fighting for town and townsman, / trying to beat the day of doom from home and children. / Seeing the man go down, dying, gasping for breath, / she clings for dear life, screams and shrills—/ but the victors, just behind her, / digging spear-butts into her back and shoulders, / drag her off in bondage, yoked to hard labor, pain, / and the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks. / So from Odysseus\u0026rsquo; eyes ran tears of heartbreak now.\u0026rdquo; Oyssedus ponders his actions, killing,etc. Book 9: Odysseus becomes the bard and the storyteller \u0026ldquo;now I\u0026rsquo;ll speak / of the unhappy journey back which Zeus / arranged for me when I returned from war\u0026rdquo; (9.29-30) The Cicones (failure of his men to find moderation in their savagery and drunkenness) After leaving Troy, Odysseus and her men aim to get more spoils and more goods and material wealth in order to take home Heading to Immarus Plundering artifacts from countries Countries fight against Odysseus Crew ends up off course and in the land of the Lotus-eaters They manage to get away unharmed Questions: What does it mean to remember? What does it mean to forget? What is necessary to keep/lose? Questions of history and its making History has many flows Crew then ends up in the land of the Cyclopes- Takes 12 companions to seek hospitality from the locals who lead them to a cave where Polyphemus live “No man” Tricks the other cyclops \u0026ldquo;From the cave mighty Polyphemus roared: \u0026lsquo;Nobody is killing me, my friends, / by treachery, not using any force\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; (9.403-4). \u0026ldquo;He stretched out his arms, / attempting to catch anyone who tried / to escape there with the sheep\u0026rdquo; (9.415-17).” Polyphemus kills 2 of the men and eats them In order to escape, they must have Polyphemus open the door to the cave so that they can escape Get him drunk- They blind him with a stick and he is therefore unable to find Odysseus Odysseus abuses verbally the Polyphemus (Poseidon\u0026rsquo;s son)- makes Poseidon hate Odysseus The cyclops; \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t grow / any plants by hand or plough the earth, / but put their trust in the immortal gods, / and though they never sow or work the land, / still every kind of crop springs up for them\u0026rdquo; (9.92-96). \u0026ldquo;Each one of them / sets out laws for his own wives and children, / and they shun all dealings with each other\u0026rdquo; (9.101-103). \u0026ldquo;He avoided others / and lived alone, away from all the rest, / a law unto himself, a monster, made to be a thing of wonder, not like a man, / who survives by eating bread, no, more like / a soaring wooded mountain standing there / to view in isolation from the rest\u0026rdquo; (9.145-51 ). \u0026ldquo;l told the rest of my trustworthy crew / to stay there beside the ship and guard it, / while I selected twelve of my best men / and went off to explore. I took with me / a goatskin full of dark sweet wine\u0026rdquo; (9.152-55). \u0026ldquo;l was keen / to see the man in person and find out / if he would show me hospitality (9.180-82). \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re here / as suppliants to you, and Zeus protects / all suppliants and strangers—as god of guests, / he cares for all respected visitors\u0026rdquo; (9.218-21 ). Another example of the theme of hospitality Men are brash to assume that the host will agree to their indulgence Odysseus escaped through hanging onto the bottom of the sheep Another instance of Odysseus being mortal, cannot compete with the might of a god such as Poseidon Odysseus travels to Aeolia Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag of ox hide Unknown why he did this In reality this is the “bag of winds” They can see Ithaca- Odysseus falls asleep The others on the boat open the sack in order to see what is in it (they seemed to believe that it was treasure) The winds and seas push the boat back to Aeolia King is furious- no lenience \u0026ldquo;Of all living mortals, you are the worst— so you must leave this island with all speed. It would violate all sense of what is right if I helped out or guided on his way a man the blessed gods must hate. So leave. You\u0026rsquo;re here because the deathless gods despise you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Once they heard his [Antiphates] call, / the mighty Laestrygonians poured out, / thronging in countless numbers from all sides—/ not like men at all, but Giants\u0026rdquo; (131-34). They encounter man-eating giants called Laestrygonians Trapped the 12 ships- only Odysseus ship escaped They then encounter Circe and her island-turns a party of men into pigs- one escapes to warn the others Hermes gives him the antidote to Circe’s powers- makes Circe vow not to plot or take revenge against his crew. The Pigs are then turned back into men \u0026ldquo;Inside their pens they wept. / Circe threw down some feed in front of them— / acorns, beech nuts, and cornel fruit—the stuff / pigs eat when they are wallowing in mud\u0026rdquo; (10.217-220). \u0026ldquo;Take a remedial medicine with you, / and go to Circe\u0026rsquo;s house. It will protect you\u0026rdquo; (10.239-40). \u0026ldquo;l found my trusty comrades at the ship / lamenting sadly, shedding many tears. / Just as on farms calves frisk around the herd / when cows, having had their fill of grazing, / return back to the yard—they skip ahead, / and pens no longer hold them, as they run, / mooing in a crowd around their mothers, / that\u0026rsquo;s how my companions, once they saw me, / thronged around\u0026rdquo; (378-83) Odysseus and crew go to the shores of the underworld Perform a sacrifice which brings the spirits of the dead to drink the blood Also includes Odysseus aunt Claire Revealed that she died from the grief of his absence The Prophet Tiresias comes with the spirits Tiresias offers a grim future for Odysseus: \u0026ldquo;a god will make your journey bitter\u0026rdquo; (11.66) but he offers some hope and a warning: \u0026ldquo;If you leave [the cattle and rich flocks of Helios the sun god] unharmed and keep your mind / on your return, you may reach Ithaca\u0026rdquo; (71-72). Further, he tells Odysseus: \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;ll be trouble at home—insolent men / eating up your livelihood and wooing / your godlike wife by giving courtship gifts\u0026rdquo; (11 . 79-81 ). \u0026ldquo;Your death will come / out of the sea, such a gentle passing, / when you are bowed down with a ripe old age, / and your people prospering around you\u0026rdquo; (100-3). Another relationship between the mortal and the immortal “Odysseus sees a procession of military heroes and women including Ajax, Agamemnon, and Epicaste (Jocasta), the wife/mother of Oedipus. He sees other mythological figures like Tantalus and Sisyphus. Most significant, he meets Achilles.” \u0026ldquo;Before now, / while you were still alive, we Achaeans / honored you as we did the gods. And now, / since you\u0026rsquo;ve come down here, you rule with power / among those who have died. So Achilles, / you have no cause to grieve because you\u0026rsquo;re dead\u0026rdquo; (11.330-35). Achilles responds: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to comfort me about my death, / glorious Odysseus. I\u0026rsquo;d rather live . working as a wage-laborer for hire / by some other ma, one who had not land / and not much livelihood, than lord it over all the waster dead\u0026rdquo; (11.337-42) Circe warns the returned Odysseus of his next obstacles, the sirens and later, the Scylla and Charybdis. Then will arrive at Helio’s island, Thrinacia, where he’ll find the cattle and sheep not meant to be interfered with. The Sirens: \u0026ldquo;No man has ever rowed his black ship / past here without attending to our songs, / sweet-voiced melodies sung from our own lips. / That brings him joy, and he then goes away / a wiser man, for we two understand / all the misfortunes faced by Trojans and Achaeans\u0026rdquo; (12.154-60). Must also make it past the 6 headed Hydra To prevent the men from hearing the sirens and falling victim to them, beeswax is put into the men\u0026rsquo;s ears Scylla and Charybdis: \u0026ldquo;l did not mention Scylla—for she was / a threat for which there was no remedy—in case my comrades, overcome with fear, / stopped rowing and huddled up together / inside the boat\u0026rdquo; (12.191-95). \u0026ldquo;When we saw Charybdis, we were afraid / we\u0026rsquo;d be destroyed. Then Scylla snatched away / six of my companions, right from the ship / \u0026hellip; / They cried and screamed, calling me by name / on final time, their hearts in agony\u0026rdquo; (12.209-11 , 216-17). Lost six of the men on the boat to the Hydra Men are tired and do not want to continue on, and despite Odysseus not agreeing, land the ship on the island of Thrinacia At Thrinacia, observing Helios\u0026rsquo; cattle and sheep: \u0026ldquo;Shipmates, / let all of you now swear this solemn oath— / if by chance we find a herd of cattle / or a large flock of sheep, not one of you / will be so overcome with foolishness / that you will kill a cow or sheep\u0026rdquo; (12.237-42). \u0026ldquo;Once what we had stored / inside our ship was gone, they had to roam, / scouring around for game and fish and birds, / whatever came to hand\u0026rdquo; (12. 270-73). \u0026ldquo;The gods / immediately sent my men bad omens— / hides crept along the ground, while on the spits / the meat began to bellow, and a sound / like cattle lowing filled the air\u0026rdquo; (12.358-62) Helios takes his revenge, conjures a storm that wipes out all of the crew on the deck of the ship. Odysseus escapes by taking hold of a branch of a tree above the whirlpool swallowing the ship Reprisals: \u0026ldquo;All at once, West Wind whipped up / a frantic storm—the blasts of wind snapped off / both forestays on the mast, which then fell back, / \u0026hellip; / In the stern part of the ship, the falling mast / struck the helmsman on his head, caving in / his skull, every bone at once. Then he fell, / like a diver, off the boat. His proud spirit / left his bones. Then Zeus roared out his thunder / and with a bolt of lightning struck our ship. / The blow from Zeus\u0026rsquo;s lightning made our craft / shiver from stem to stern and filled it up / with sulphur smoke. My men fell overboard / and rode atop the waves\u0026rdquo; (12.375-88). I was guided to Ogygia by the gods, / the island where fair-haired Calypso live\u0026rdquo; (12.420-21). Odysseus is returned to Ithaca by the Phaeacians as he sleeps (Book 13) Does not initially recognize his homeland Athena: \u0026ldquo;Stranger, you must be a fool, or else come / from somewhere far away, if you must ask / about this land. Its name is not unknown— / not at all—many men have heard of it. Ithaca is well known, even in Troy, / a long way from Achaean land, they say\u0026rdquo; (13.80-85). \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what Fate has in store for you. / You\u0026rsquo;ll find harsh troubles in your well-built home. / Be patient, for you must endure them all\u0026rdquo; (104-6). \u0026ldquo;she touched him with her staff. / She wrinkled the lovely skin on his supple limbs / and took the dark hair from his head\u0026rdquo; (13.152-54) Book 14 Meets Eumeaus, the swineherd, a slave that is the most loyal to him Still remains committed to Odysseus \u0026ldquo;It would be wrong, / stranger, for me to disrespect a guest, / even if one worse off than you arrive, / for every guest and beggar comes from Zeus\u0026rdquo; (14.41-44).” Theme of Hospitality repeats again Eumeanus is hospitable to Odysseus (in disguise), and attempts to make him comfortable even with his meager means Book 15: Athena tells Telemachus to hurry home. Warns him about the trap that the suitors have set for him. Has his ship drop him off before the city so that he can approach in secret. Odysseus and Eumaeus spend an evening together Book 16: Telemachus arrives at Eumaeus’s hut and then sees his son for the first time in 20 years. They share Eumaeus’s food. When Eumaeus leaves, Athena transforms Odysseus into his real self. They then lay out their plans to defeat the suitors- 108 suitors and ten servants Eumaeus gives Penelope the message- at the same time as Telemachus sailors arrive Plot against Telemachus’s life, even while denying that they mean him harm when confronted by Penelope \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not one of the gods. / Why do you compare me to immortals? / But I am your father, on whose account / you are grieving and suffer distress / having to bear men\u0026rsquo;s acts of insolence\u0026rdquo; (16. 95-99). Odysseus\u0026rsquo; plan is slaughter, but Telemachus is clear about their odds: \u0026ldquo;Here, you can soon add up / their numbers—from Dulichium there are / fifty two hand-picked young men, six servants / in their retinue, from Same [nearby island] twenty-four, / from Zacynthus twenty young Achaeans, and from Ithaca itself twelve young men, / all nobility\u0026rdquo; (16.134-40). \u0026ldquo;Do you believe Athena, / along with Father Zeus, will be enough / for the two of us, or should I think about / who else might help us?\u0026rdquo; (16.151-54). Book 17: Eumaeus orders Eumaeus to bring the beggar to the palace Telemachus goes ahead and returns home and receives a welcome Encounter Melanthius the goatherd who gives Odysseus a kick and some verbal abuse Suitors have a feast Antinous and Eurymachus are the leaders of the suitors “Bk 17 Eumaeus (unwittingly) will bring Odysseus into the city still in disguise as an old beggar On the way, they are accosted by Melanthius, a servant of the suitors: \u0026ldquo;Now here we have a truly filthy man / leading on another filthy scoundrel. / As always, a god matches like with like\u0026rdquo; (17.99-101 \u0026ldquo;It was Argus, brave Odysseus\u0026rsquo;s hunting dog / \u0026hellip;. / Argus lay there / covered in fleas. But then, when he saw Odysseus / who was coming closer, Argus wages his tail / and dropped his ears / \u0026hellip;. / once Book 18: Good for nothing beggar arrives at the palace Outraged to find another beggar, he is aggressive towards Odysseus Disguised, Odysseus begs from each of the suitors, testing them. Antinous, their leader, is cruel: \u0026ldquo;What god / sent this nuisance to interrupt our feast? / You\u0026rsquo;re an insolent and shameless beggar— / you come up to each of us, one by one, / and we give you things without holding back, / for there\u0026rsquo;s no check or scruple when one gives / from someone else\u0026rsquo;s goods, and each of us / has so much food set here in front of him\u0026rdquo; (17.194-201)he\u0026rsquo;d seen Odysseus after nineteen years, / Argus collapsed, gripped in the fatal clutch of death\u0026rdquo; (17.117, 125-28, 54-55).” Melantho a slave girl who sleeps with Eurymachus mocks Odysseus Book 19: Book 19 Odysseus meets with Penelope: \u0026ldquo;he made his many falsehoods sound just like the truth\u0026rdquo; (19.42). Penelope tests him as well: \u0026ldquo;if you did, in fact, entertain / my husband and his fine companions there, in your halls, as you just claimed. So describe / the style of clothing he was wearing\u0026rdquo; (19.56-59). His old nurse Eurycleia recognizes the disguised Odysseus from the scar on his leg: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s true dear child, / You are Odysseus—I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you, / until my hands had touched my master\u0026rsquo;s leg\u0026rdquo; (164-66). She is sworn to secrecy Penelope fails to recognize her husband Odysseus assures Penelope that the suitors will be destroyed Book 21: Bk 21: the contest with bow and axes: Penelope: \u0026ldquo;So come now, suitors, since I seem to be / the prize you seek, I\u0026rsquo;ll place this great bow here— / a weapon that belonged to great Odysseus. / Whichever one of you can grip this bow and string it with the greatest ease, then shoot / an arrow through twelve axes, all of them, / I\u0026rsquo;ll go with him, leaving my married home, / this truly lovely house and all these goods / one needs for living—things I\u0026rsquo;ll remember, / even in my dreams\u0026rdquo; (21 .16-26). \u0026ldquo;If Odysseus were to come back suddenly, / \u0026hellip; would you two / be the sort of men who would defend him?\u0026rdquo; (21.104-5). Reckoning with the suitors String bow and shoot through axes None of the suitors can do it Suitors decide to give up and try again tomorrow Reveals himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius Odysseus strings the bow easily and shoots through the 12 axe heads Antinous, i his cowardice, having seen Eurymachus fail at the bow, urges them all to put this aside and feast some more: \u0026ldquo;At this moment, / in this country there\u0026rsquo;s a feast day, sacred / to the god. So who would bend the bow! No, / set it aside without saying a thing\u0026rdquo; (21.173-76). But Odysseus steps forwards and ask for a chance with the weapon. He is mocked but Penelope insists. Book 22 \u0026ldquo;Shrewd Odysseus, / once he\u0026rsquo;d lifted up the bow and looked it over / from every angle, then—just as someone truly skilled / at playing the lyre and singing has no trouble / when he loops a taut string around a brand new peg, / tying the twisted sheep\u0026rsquo;s gut down at either end—/ that\u0026rsquo;s how easily lord Odysseus strung that bow\u0026rdquo; (21.254-60). \u0026ldquo;This contest to determine who is best / is over. But there\u0026rsquo;s another target— / one no man has ever struck—I\u0026rsquo;ll find out / if I can hit it. May Apollo grant / I get the glory\u0026rdquo; (22. 5-9) \u0026ldquo;The suitors kept throwing spears with frantic haste, / but though there were a lot, Athena made them miss\u0026rdquo; (22. 232-33). Odysseus sits in the doorway and blocks the suitors route out of the courtyard Suitors are outraged and don\u0026rsquo;t realize that it is Odysseus Osydeus and the others are protected from the arrows and the other suitors trying to kill him Book 23 \u0026ldquo;Wake up now, Penelope, my dear child, so you yourself can see with your own eyes what you\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting each and every day. Odysseus has arrived. He may be late, but he\u0026rsquo;s back in the house. And he\u0026rsquo;s just killed those haughty suitors who upset this home, used up his goods, and victimized his son.\u0026rdquo; Ossedyus knows that he has created danger due to the killing of the large number of suitors Odysseus and Penlope reunite \u0026ldquo;Strange man, / I am not making too much of myself, / or ignoring you. Nor is it the case / that you\u0026rsquo;ve offended me in any way. / \u0026hellip; / So, come, Eurycleia, set up for him / outside the well-built bedroom that strong bed / he made himself. Put that sturdy bedstead / out there for him and throw some bedding on , / fleeces and cloaks and shining coverlets\u0026rdquo; (23.104-14). \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s shifted my bed / to somewhere else?\u0026rdquo; (23.119) Book 24 Achilles and Agamemnon have a conversation about in the Underworld when the shades of the suitors arrive\nOdysseus and other three arrive at the farm of Laertes\nThe suitors family attempt to kill Odysseus but Athena intervenes and forces them to swear allegiance to Odysseus\n\u0026ldquo;People heard about it all at once and came in / from all directions, gathering with mournful sighs / before Odysseus\u0026rsquo; home. Each one brought his dead / outside the house and buried them, and all the men / from other cities they sent home, carrying them / aboard swift ships to be taken back by sailors. / Then, with sorrowful hearts, they all went in person / to meet i an assembly\u0026rdquo; (24. 91-97). \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll be eternally disgraced / If we don\u0026rsquo;t act to take our revenge / on those killers of our sons and brothers. / I\u0026rsquo;d rather die right now / and live among the d (24.112-18).\nAthena to Zeus: \u0026ldquo;Will you now foster / further savage war and fearful battle, / or bring both sides together as friends?\u0026rdquo; (24. 144-46).

(7-12) she knew Europa\u0026rsquo;s son the best of all, the countenance of Minos being more familiar to her than it should have been. (27-29)\nIn peacetime, Scylla, daughter of King Nisus, would often come and toss a pebble here.

(121-26) Her father, hovering on yellow wings (for he had just been changed into an osprey), caught sight of her and dove to the attack. Feathers appear upon her hands; transformed into a bird, she is now known as Ciris, and has this name from the clipped lock of hair. (197-99, 204-6)\nMinos and Adriane# The scandal of his family had grown past all concealment; not the mother\u0026rsquo;s [Pasiphae] foul adultery was proven by the strange form of the Minotaur, half man, half bull. Minos determined to remove the cause of this opprobrium from his abode, enclosing it within a labyrinth devised and built by Daedalus. (212-19)\nMinos confined the monstrous form within the labyrinth, and twice it had been fed on the blood of sacrificed Athenians; after another nine-year interval, the third demand for tribute doomed the creature, when, by the aid of Princess Ariadne, the path back to the hidden entranceway, which none before had ever reached again, was rediscovered when the thread was wound; then Theseus abducted Minos\u0026rsquo; daughter and sailed to Dia, where he cruelly abandoned his companion to her wailing. (233-35)\nAssume that most readers already know the story\nMeanwhile, detesting Crete and his long exile, and longing to return to his own nation, Daedalus found that an escape by sea was closed to him. (252-54) Icarus, his boy, was standing close by, unaware of any danger in the things he handled; he smiled as he snatched at wisps of feathers blown from his father\u0026rsquo;s workbench by a passing breeze, or left a thumbprint in the golden wax and playfully got in his father\u0026rsquo;s way. (269-75)\nAnd as he works and as he warns the boy, the old man\u0026rsquo;s cheeks are dampened by his tears; the father\u0026rsquo;s hands are trembling as he gives his son a not-to-be-repeated kiss, and lifts off on his wings into the air. (291-95) Some fisherman whose line jerks with his catch, some idle shepherd leaning on his crook, some plowman at his plow, looks up and sees something astonishing, and thinks them gods, who have the power to pass through the air. (303-7)\nDaedalus and Perdix# As he entombs his child\u0026rsquo;s pathetic corpse, he is observed from where a rank ditch drips, by a chatty partridge, who chirps cheerfully and makes his wing tips flutter in applause (328-31) Daedalus envied him, and headlong hurled this lad of precepts from a precipice (348-49)\nImpious Acts and Exemplary lives# What does it mean to be \u0026ldquo;impious\u0026rdquo;?

The highest note of a melody Legato → Sung or played in a smooth or connected setup Staccato → May be performed in a short or detached matter Letters commonly used for discussing the segments of the peices lowercase for shorter sections (a,b,etc) Uppercase letters for longer sections (A,B,etc) Melody and Words# Melody expresses the meaning and emotion of the words Melody can evoke feeling in the listeners Chapter 6- Harmony# Harmony refers to the way chords are constructed and how they follow each other Consonance and Dissonance# Consonance → A tone combination that is stable Dissonance → A tone combination that is unstable Tension demands an onward motion to a stable Resolution → Dissonance has its resolution when it moves to a consonance Consonance and dissonance can exist in varying degrees Some or more or less stable than other The Triad# Triad → Most basic chord Harmony- simultaneous tones in music that add support and richness to melody Tonic chord → The main chord of the piece Subdominant chord - the triad based on the fourth note of the scale Dominant chord- built on the fifth note Cadence - means both the resting point at the end of the melodic phrase Broken Chords (Arpeggios)# Broken Chord or Arpeggio - Individual tones of a chord are sounded one after another Chapter 7- Key# Key involves not only a central tone but also a central scale or chord Scale is the basic pitches of a piece of music arranged from low to high The Major Key# The major scale has two kinds of intervals: Half-steps and whole-steps Half-step is the smallest interval traditionally used in western music Whole step is twice as large as the half step The Minor Scale# Consists of seven different tones and an eighth tone that duplicates the first an octave higher Minor scale can begin on any of the twelve tones in an octave Thus, there are 12 minor scales Major and Minor keys# When a piece is based off of a major scale → Major Key When a piece of music is based off of a minor scale → Minor Key To indicate the key of a music - composer uses a key signature The Chromatic Scale# Twelve tones of the octave form the chromatic scale Tones of the chromatic scale same distance apart, unlike major and minor scales Tones are one half-step apart Chromatic scale does not define a key Contribute to a sense of motion and tension Modulation- Change of key# Short pieces of music - single key from beginning to end Longer pieces of music, variety or contrast created by using more than one key Modulation → Shifting from one key to another within the piece Tonic Key# No matter the amount that a piece has been changed, there is usually only one home note Modulation is moving away from the home key, but then eventually returning to the home key Chapter 8- Musical Texture# Musical texture - refers to how many different layers of sound are heard at a time Described as: Dense Thin Thick Heavy Light Monophonic Texture# Monophonic → Having one sound Singing alone Single line with the same pitch in unison makes a stronger sound than singing alone Polyphonic Texture# Polyphonic → Having many sounds Each line of the piece enriches the other Counterpoint → Combining several melodic lines into a whole Round → song in which the same melody is sung or played at slightly different times Homophonic Texture# Homophonic → One main melody accompanied by chords Chords are subordinate to the melody Chapter 9- Musical forms# Form → organization of musical elements in time Techniques that Create Musical Form# Repetition → Creates a sense of unity Contrast → Provides variety Variation → keeps some elements of musical thought while changing others - gives a work unity and variety at the same time Repetition# Appeals to the pleasure we get in recognizing and remembering something Passage of time influences our reaction to repetition Contrast# Forward motion, conflict and change of mood Variation# Some ideas will be retained while others are changed Melody might be restated with a different accompaniment Types of Musical form# ABA Form# Contrast between A and B and then return to AB (Binary form)# Composition made up of two section is in two part form AABB Chapter 10- Musical Style# Style - refers to a characteristic was of using melody, rhythm, tone color The was these elements are combined can result in a total sound that’s unique Musical styles can change from one era to the next History of western art can be divided into the periods: Middle Ages (450-1450) Renaissance (1450-1600) Baroque (1600-1750) Classical (1750-1820) Romantic (1820-1900) Twentieth century to 1945 1945 to the present "},{"id":43,"href":"/notes/semester-1/mu-100/part-2/","title":"Part 2","section":"MU 100","content":"Chapter 11- Music in the Middle Ages# Most important musicians were priests and worked for the church Liturgical singing Boys received music education in schools associated with churches and cathedrals Most medieval was vocal- musicians also performed on a wide variety of instruments “pronouncing the words of the Holy spirit” Instruments incorporated into church music after 1800 We don’t know much about how medieval music sounded- most of the instruments have been destroyed Gregorian Chant# Official music of the Roman Catholic church for over 1000 years Designed to enhance specific parts of religious services Conveys calm, otherworldly quality Flexible rhythm, no meter, little sense of beat Almost an improvisational character, due to the lack of beat and flexible Named after Pope Gregory 1= 590-604 Originally passed down through oral tradition, later notated Composers completely unknown The Church Modes# Gregorian chant results partly from unfamiliar scales “Church modes” Same as major and minor scales, but half steps are different Secular music in the Middle Ages# Secular music → Music outside of the church 13th century Dance in wooded places, parties, etc. Troubadour and Trouvere Song# Active in courts of the nobility and in towns during the 12th and 13th centuries Troubadours- Live in southern France and write poems in the Provencal language Trouveres- Flourish in northern France and write in Old French Mostly about courtly/idealized love for the idea noble lady Different backgrounds- some nobles, some have modest backgrounds Notated as single melodic lines Monophonic texture Minstrels# Entertained in castles, public places, etc. Perform music, told stories Lowest social level with no civil rights Not many found steady work Important source of info because there were no newspapers The Development of Polyphony: Organum# Type of polyphony Original music in this time had a single melodic line Monks in monasteries begin to add a second melodic line to Gregorian chant Originally improvised Duplication of original melody at diff pitch Developed a melodic curve of its own 1100- not restricted to a note against not style Lines could differ rhythmically as melodically School of Notre Dame: Measured Rhythm# 1150- Paris becomes a center of polyphonic music Measured rhythm -

B\nMinuet- A\nOften contains woodwind solos\nMinuet is structurally the simplest movement of a symphony or quartet\nIn many of Beethoven’s works, the third movement is not a minuet but related form called a scherzo Rondo# Rondo → Tuneful main theme (A) that returns several times-alternation with other themes AVACA ABACABA Main theme is usually stated in the tonic key, its return is all the more welcome Rondo form is often combined with elements of sonata form to produce a sonata-rondo Contains a development section like that in sonata form is outlined ABA-development-ABA The Classical Symphony# Greatest contribution of the classical period to orchestral music is symphonies\nHaydn = 1-4 symphonies Mozart = 40+ Beethoven = 9 Symphony → Extended, ambitious composition typically lasting between twenty and 45 min. Uses the expanded range of tone color and dynamics of the classical orchestra\nUsually consists of four movements that evoke a wide range of emotions through contrasts of tempo and mood Vigorous- Dramatic fast movement\nUsually the most dramatic movement Sonata form A lyrical slow movement\nMost likely to find broad, songlike melodies here Sonata form: ABA Dancelike movement (minuet or scherzo)\nFor Haydn and Mozart is generally a minuet and trio which may be in a moderate or fairly quick tempo Varies from courtly dance to a peasant romp or vigorous piece that is not very dancelike Beethoven likes fast, energetic scherzos A brilliant or heroic fast movement\nConcluding movement of a symphony by Haydn or Mozart is fast, lively and brilliant but somewhat lighter in mood than the opening statement In most of the classical symphonies each movement is a self contained composition with its own set of themes\nA theme in one movement will only rarely reappear in a later movement\nImportance of the symphony lasted throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first\nQuestions:\nThe Classical Concerto# 3 movement work for an instrumental soloist and orchestra Combines the soloists virtuosity and interpretive abilities with the orchestra’s wide range of tone color and dynamics Contrast of ideas and sound that is dramatic and staisfying Soloist is very much the star and all of his or her musical talents are needed in this challenging dialogue Classical love of balance can be seen in the concerto, because soloist and orchestra are equally important Concertos can last around the same length as symphonies- concertos can last anywhere from 20 min to 45 min First movement and sometimes in the last movement - special unaccompanied showpiece for the soloist Orchestra suspends forward motion by briefly sustaining a dissonant chord Suspense announces the entry of the soloists cadenza Soloist usually improvised the cadenzas Performers of eighteenth century concertos have a choice of cadenzas Own performance or that of a student Best when a style matches concerto Best when their style matches that of the concerto A classical concerto begins with a movement in sonata form of a special king, containing two expositions Orchestra plays which represents home key Second exposition is soloists first notes Could be powerful or quiet - dramatic because suspense has been built Classical Chamber Music# Designed for intimate setting rather than a public concert hall Performed by small group of 2 to 9 One player to a part Lighter in sound than classical orchestral music Fashionable for an aristocrat or a member of the well-to do middle class to play chamber music with friends and to hir professional musicians to entertain guests Subtle and intimate- please the performer and the listener Group is a team Each member is essential Give and take is called for among the string instruments Does not need a conductor- listen to each other and adjust String Quartet 2 violins, a viola and a cello Modeled after a conversation between four intelligent individuals Four movements: Fast Slow Minuet or Scherzo Fast Sonata for violin and piano is another popular form Much chamber music is performed by amateurs Joseph Haydn# Born in Austrian village called Rohrau Musical background consisted of folksongs and peasant dances At age 8- he went to Vienna to serve as a choirboy in the Cathedral of St Stephen Voice changed Gave lessons to children Entered the service of Esterhazys- Richest and most powerful of the Hungarian noble families Compose all music requested by patron Conduct orchestra Oversee instruments and the music library As an individual Haydn was good humored Conscientious about his duties 1795- Return to Vienna rich and honored Choruses and Orchestras were formed for the sole purpose of performing them Died in 1809 Haydn’s music# Pathfinder for the classical style Mozart and Beethoven were influenced by his style Music is robust and direct Most of it has a folk flavor Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart# Wrote a symphony at age 8 Oratorio at 11 Opera at 12 Mozart\u0026rsquo;s father was eager to show him off- continuously on tour until about age 15 Mozart won more acclaim as a boy than as an adult He could not tolerate being treated like a servant in Saulsbury Traveled to Vienna Mozart was more successful in his last year and tried to complete the requiem for a mass of the dead Mozart Music# The most versatile of all composers Wrote masterpieces of the all the musical forms of his time- symphonies, string quartets, piano concertos and operas Ludwig van Beethoven# Born in Bonn, Germany Serving as assistant to the court organist Several piano compositions published Played for Mozart at 16 Studied with Haydn in Vienna where he spent the rest of his life City dazzled by his virtuosity and moved by his improvisations Three nobleman committed themselves to give him an annual income as long as he was in Vienna Beethoven felt the first symptoms of Deafness in 1802 Discussed the mental issues that he encountered Often dressed sloppily and fell in and out of love with women By the time he was 44 he was unable to effectively conduct an orchestra due to his lack of hearing "},{"id":45,"href":"/notes/semester-1/mu-100/part-5/","title":"Part 5","section":"MU 100","content":"Chapter 5# The Art song (lied)# Art sing is a composition for solo voice and piano Accompaniment is a integral part of the composers concept Original meant to be sung at home, not at concert halls Poetry and music are fused in the art song - flourished with increasing amount of romantic poetry Song composers would interpret or translate a poem into musical form Song Forms# Strophic form makes a song easy to remember and is used in almost all folk songs Repeats the same music in each stanza Through composed forms writes new music for each stanza Used to reflect poems changing moods The Song Cycle# Romantic songs are usually grouped in a set or, song cycle Sometimes unified by a story line that runs through poems or by musical ideas that link the songs Franz Schubert# 1797-1828 Earliest master of the Romantic art song Never held an official position- made his income entirely through composition Schubert was born in Vienna, son of a schoolmaster Composed a large number of works in his late teenage years Wrote Gretchen am Spindale and The Erlking Composed close to 200 works per year Most of his works were designed to be performed for the middle class Did not mingle with the aristocracy Died in 1828 at the age of 31 Schubert’s Music# Schubert composed over 600 works The melodies of his songs have a larger variety of moods and types. Some folklike tunes to complex lines that suggest impassioned speech Schubert\u0026rsquo;s harmonies and dissonances provide some poetic moments in music Spirit of song permeates Schubert\u0026rsquo;s music too Symphonies and chamber works have longer lyrical melodies Most of his famous Trout Quintet in A minor Most of the symphonies and chamber works have long, lyrical melodies which are sometimes comparable in power and intensity to those his idol Erlking is a great example of musical romanticism Piano part builds the excitement of the work Also the piano parts unifies the episodes of the song and suggests the horse’s gallop Schubert varies the music makes one signer sound like several characters in a miniature drama Robert Schumann# 1810-1856 His works are autobiographical and usually have descriptive titles, texts, or programs Born in Germany and studied law at Leipzig university Devoted most of his time to music Had an issue with his hand that sometimes hampered his ability to play music Schumann’s Music# Composed many art songs in 1840 Clara Wieck Schumann# Leading concert pianists of the nineteenth century 1819-1896 Premiered many works by her husband, Robert Schumann and by Johannes Brahms Was the daughter of Marianne Wieck Father trained her to be a child prodigy who would both earn money and demonstrate the superiority of his teaching methods Continued to concertize and compose though on a reduced scale while caring for seven children After Robert Schumann\u0026rsquo;s death, Clara expanded her performance activities Considered herself primarily a performance artist In recent times, the compositions have become more and more performed Fredric Chopin# 1810-1849 Wrote almost exclusively for the piano Son of a Polish mother and French father and was brought up in Warsaw At 21 moved to Paris which was the center of romanticism and the artistic capital of Europe Gained access to aristocratic salons Preferred salons to concert halls - conceived short pieces such as the nocturnes, preludes and waltzes Died of tuberculosis at 39 years old Chopin\u0026rsquo;s Music# Personal and original styles Miniatures- Most of his pieces evoked a variety of moods and are elegant, peaceful and melodic His melodic gift creates the illusion that the piano is signing Composed Nocturne in E flat major, Op 9, No 2 when he was around 20 Slow, lyrical composition for piano Opens with a Legato melody containing graceful upward leaps, which become more wide as the line unfolds Melody occurs three times throughout the piece Includes a subordinate melody that is played with slight fluctuations in the tempo Widely spaced notes in the accompaniment Rev Etude in C minor May have been inspired by the Russian takeover of Warsaw in 1831 Speed and endurance is developed in the Pianists left hand, which plays rapid passages throughout A A’ Form High dissonant chords and downward rushing passages lead to the main melody At the end of the A’ Franz Liszt# 1811-1886 During the 1840s performed superhuman feats on the piano Overwhelms the European public Impressing musicians and the concertgoing public Born in Hungary Studied in Vienna at age 11, met Schubert and Beethoven Moved to Paris in teens and twenties Met Pagani, a violinists, and resolved to become greater at the piano, came back to stage life a couple of years later as a great pianist Composed the Transcendental Etudes and made Piano transcriptions of Paganins violin pieces At 36 became a court conductor in Wien mar to establish himself as a serious composer Provided free piano education to Gifted individuals Became president of the New Academy of Music Liszt\u0026rsquo;s Music# Created the Symphonic poem- a one movement orchestral composition based to some extent on literary or pectoral ideas Felix Mendelson# Romantic whose music was rooted in classical tradition Born in Hamburg Germany Young prodigy Conducted Bach’s St Matthews Passion in its first performance since Bachs death Rekindled interest in Bachs music Earned him an international reputation Often visited and played for Queen Victoria Personal life more conventional than most romantic composers Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel# Older sister of Felix Melssohn\nSince the 1980s, her works have become more and more performed\nAt thirteen, in honor of her father\u0026rsquo;s birthday, Fanny played from memory all the twenty-four Preludes from Bach\u0026rsquo;s The Well-Tempered Clavier, and at fourteen, composed songs and piano pieces. However, her father limited Fanny\u0026rsquo;s musical ambitions by saying that as an upper-class young woman she could never aspire to be a professional musician like her brother Felix: \u0026ldquo;Music will perhaps be his profession, whilst for you it can only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing.\u0026rdquo; Even her beloved brother Felix agreed with their father and discouraged Fanny from publishing her compositions. In 1826, two of her songs were published together with four songs by Felix under his name. Years later Felix visited Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace and accompanied her as she sang a song she thought was by him. After the Queen praised the song, Felix admitted to her that it was composed by his sister. When she was twenty-three, Fanny married Wilhelm Hensel, painter at the court in Berlin, who encouraged her musical activities. The couple\u0026rsquo;s only child was named Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel after Fanny\u0026rsquo;s favorite composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Felix Mendelssohn. In 1831, Fanny became music director and performer at Sunday concerts in the Mendelssohn family mansion, reviving the musicales her parents had hosted years before. Fanny\u0026rsquo;s concerts were attended by up to 200 invited guests from Berlin\u0026rsquo;s elite. The works heard included compositions ranging from Bach to Chopin, and guest performers included such famous virtuosos as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. In 1846, persuaded by praise from musicians, Fanny wrote in her diary, \u0026ldquo;I have made up my mind to publish my things.\u0026rdquo; To Felix she wrote: \u0026ldquo;I am as afraid of you my brother at age 40 as I was of Father at age 14\u0026hellip;1 hope I won\u0026rsquo;t disgrace all of you through my publishing.\u0026rdquo; Felix replied giving Fanny his \u0026ldquo;professional blessing on your decision to join our guild.\u0026rdquo; Several of her works finally appeared in print under her name, but less than a year later, in 1847 at age forty-one, Fanny died of a stroke.\nProgram Music# Romantic composers were particularly attracted to program music- music associate with a story, poem, idea or scene Fantastic Symphony Romeo and Juliet Moldau Hector Berlioz# One of the first romantic composers and a daring creator of new orchestral sounds Born in a small town near Grenoble Originally was supposed to study medicine in Paris Studied at the Paris Conservatory, composed and went to the Opera House Liked the works of Shakespeare Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Music# Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky# Antonin Dvorak# Johannes Brahms# Romantic who breathed new life into classical forms Georges Bizet# Giuseppe Verdi# Giacomo Puccini# Richard Wagner# "}]
