Also given solo passages Percussion# Struck with hand, sticks or hammers or shaken or rubbed Vibrations of percussion instruments are caused by stretched membranes for certain instruments or by plates, bars ,etc. Percussion instruments have been used to emphasize rhythm, build suspense, etc. Oft used by Jazz Musicians Keyboard instruments# Instruments Piano Invented around 1700- perfected by the 1850’s Sound produced by strings and hammers The more that you hit the string, the louder it will be Pedals to sustain the tone, veil tone, sustains some tones, not others Harpsichord 1775- replaced by pianos Harpsichord Organ Accordion Pipe Organ Often used for religious ceremonies Accordian Most used in folk setting Electronic Instruments# Produce or amplify sound via electronic means Invented around 1904 Significant impact on music since 1950 Types Electric piano Electric Organ Electric Guitars Synthesizers Generate, modify, and control sound Can be played via a keyboard 1960’s-70’s smaller, less expensive keyboards developed Allow for the manipulation of sounds MIDI, synthesizers work like a Piano Tape Studio Main tool in the 1950’s Les Paul,etc Including recorded sounds Manipulated sounds Sampling enables composers to hear what their music sounds like using digital technology Digital Audio Workstations → DAWs Chapter 3# Rhythm# Recurring pattern of tension and release Refers to the ordered durations of sounds and silence Beat# Regular, recurrent pulsation Units of time in which all tones are measured Combination of different durations of tones creates the rhythm Meter# All of this is part of meter Some beats feel stronger or more stressed than others Meter → The organization of beats into regular groups Measure or Bar → A group containing a fixed number of number of beats Downbeat → The first or stressed beat of the measure Quadruple meter → 4 beats to the measure, the downbeat is the strongest Jazz and Rock are usually quadruple meter Sextuple Meter→ 6 rather quick beats to the measure Accent and Syncopation# Individual notes are stressed - how they get special emphasis Accent - note is emphasized by being played louder than the notes around it Syncopation → Accented note comes where there one is not expected When an offbeat note is accented Tempo# Tempo is the speed of the beat Fast → associated of energy, drive and excitement Slow → Solemn, lyrical and calm mood Tempo indication is usually given at beginning of a piece in Italian Accelerando - quickening of the tempo Ritardando - becoming slower Chapter 4- Notating Pitch# Horizontal lines on a staff are called ledger lines Seven pitches/tones are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G Repeated over to represent the same tones in higher and lower octaves Other 5 tones of the octave correspond to the black keys of the piano Indicated by sharp sign or a flat sign Natural sign cancel a previous sharp or flat sign Clef is placed at the beginning of the staff Treble clef- used for high ranges Bass clef- used for low ranges Notating Rhythm# Nation does not indicate the exact duration of tones, it shows how long oen tone lasts in relation to others in the same piece Depends on how the note is written- with stems or flags To lengthen a notes, we can make it a dotted note - increases the duration of the note by a half Tue also lengthens the duration of the note- connected by a tie Rhythmic variety - triplet, etc. Notating silence# Notating Meter# Time signature/ meter signature shows the meter of a peice\nAppears at the beginning of the staff at the start of a piece\n$$ \\frac{2}{4} \\text{-2 beats to the measure and a quarter note gets 1 beat. The most common meter is} \\frac{3}{4}. \\text{Quadruple meter is} \\frac{4}{4} $$\nChapter 5# Melody# Melody → Series of single tones that add up to add up to a recognizable whole Has direction, shape and continuity Conveys tension and release, expectation and arrival Melodic curve or line Climax - The highest note of a melody Legato → Sung or played in a smooth or connected setup Staccato → May be performed in a short or detached matter Letters commonly used for discussing the segments of the peices lowercase for shorter sections (a,b,etc) Uppercase letters for longer sections (A,B,etc) Melody and Words# Melody expresses the meaning and emotion of the words Melody can evoke feeling in the listeners Chapter 6- Harmony# Harmony refers to the way chords are constructed and how they follow each other Consonance and Dissonance# Consonance → A tone combination that is stable Dissonance → A tone combination that is unstable Tension demands an onward motion to a stable Resolution → Dissonance has its resolution when it moves to a consonance Consonance and dissonance can exist in varying degrees Some or more or less stable than other The Triad# Triad → Most basic chord Harmony- simultaneous tones in music that add support and richness to melody Tonic chord → The main chord of the piece Subdominant chord - the triad based on the fourth note of the scale Dominant chord- built on the fifth note Cadence - means both the resting point at the end of the melodic phrase Broken Chords (Arpeggios)# Broken Chord or Arpeggio - Individual tones of a chord are sounded one after another Chapter 7- Key# Key involves not only a central tone but also a central scale or chord Scale is the basic pitches of a piece of music arranged from low to high The Major Key# The major scale has two kinds of intervals: Half-steps and whole-steps Half-step is the smallest interval traditionally used in western music Whole step is twice as large as the half step The Minor Scale# Consists of seven different tones and an eighth tone that duplicates the first an octave higher Minor scale can begin on any of the twelve tones in an octave Thus, there are 12 minor scales Major and Minor keys# When a piece is based off of a major scale → Major Key When a piece of music is based off of a minor scale → Minor Key To indicate the key of a music - composer uses a key signature The Chromatic Scale# Twelve tones of the octave form the chromatic scale Tones of the chromatic scale same distance apart, unlike major and minor scales Tones are one half-step apart Chromatic scale does not define a key Contribute to a sense of motion and tension Modulation- Change of key# Short pieces of music - single key from beginning to end Longer pieces of music, variety or contrast created by using more than one key Modulation → Shifting from one key to another within the piece Tonic Key# No matter the amount that a piece has been changed, there is usually only one home note Modulation is moving away from the home key, but then eventually returning to the home key Chapter 8- Musical Texture# Musical texture - refers to how many different layers of sound are heard at a time Described as: Dense Thin Thick Heavy Light Monophonic Texture# Monophonic → Having one sound Singing alone Single line with the same pitch in unison makes a stronger sound than singing alone Polyphonic Texture# Polyphonic → Having many sounds Each line of the piece enriches the other Counterpoint → Combining several melodic lines into a whole Round → song in which the same melody is sung or played at slightly different times Homophonic Texture# Homophonic → One main melody accompanied by chords Chords are subordinate to the melody Chapter 9- Musical forms# Form → organization of musical elements in time Techniques that Create Musical Form# Repetition → Creates a sense of unity Contrast → Provides variety Variation → keeps some elements of musical thought while changing others - gives a work unity and variety at the same time Repetition# Appeals to the pleasure we get in recognizing and remembering something Passage of time influences our reaction to repetition Contrast# Forward motion, conflict and change of mood Variation# Some ideas will be retained while others are changed Melody might be restated with a different accompaniment Types of Musical form# ABA Form# Contrast between A and B and then return to AB (Binary form)# Composition made up of two section is in two part form AABB Chapter 10- Musical Style# Style - refers to a characteristic was of using melody, rhythm, tone color The was these elements are combined can result in a total sound that’s unique Musical styles can change from one era to the next History of western art can be divided into the periods: Middle Ages (450-1450) Renaissance (1450-1600) Baroque (1600-1750) Classical (1750-1820) Romantic (1820-1900) Twentieth century to 1945 1945 to the present "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/semester-1/mu-100/part-2/","title":"Part 2","section":"MU 100","content":"Chapter 11- Music in the Middle Ages# Most important musicians were priests and worked for the church Liturgical singing Boys received music education in schools associated with churches and cathedrals Most medieval was vocal- musicians also performed on a wide variety of instruments “pronouncing the words of the Holy spirit” Instruments incorporated into church music after 1800 We don’t know much about how medieval music sounded- most of the instruments have been destroyed Gregorian Chant# Official music of the Roman Catholic church for over 1000 years Designed to enhance specific parts of religious services Conveys calm, otherworldly quality Flexible rhythm, no meter, little sense of beat Almost an improvisational character, due to the lack of beat and flexible Named after Pope Gregory 1= 590-604 Originally passed down through oral tradition, later notated Composers completely unknown The Church Modes# Gregorian chant results partly from unfamiliar scales “Church modes” Same as major and minor scales, but half steps are different Secular music in the Middle Ages# Secular music → Music outside of the church 13th century Dance in wooded places, parties, etc. Troubadour and Trouvere Song# Active in courts of the nobility and in towns during the 12th and 13th centuries Troubadours- Live in southern France and write poems in the Provencal language Trouveres- Flourish in northern France and write in Old French Mostly about courtly/idealized love for the idea noble lady Different backgrounds- some nobles, some have modest backgrounds Notated as single melodic lines Monophonic texture Minstrels# Entertained in castles, public places, etc. Perform music, told stories Lowest social level with no civil rights Not many found steady work Important source of info because there were no newspapers The Development of Polyphony: Organum# Type of polyphony Original music in this time had a single melodic line Monks in monasteries begin to add a second melodic line to Gregorian chant Originally improvised Duplication of original melody at diff pitch Developed a melodic curve of its own 1100- not restricted to a note against not style Lines could differ rhythmically as melodically School of Notre Dame: Measured Rhythm# 1150- Paris becomes a center of polyphonic music Measured rhythm - definite time values and clearly defined meter Notation describes precise rhythm and pitches By modern standards, medieval polyphony is hollow and thin Lack of triads 2 intervals of a third 14th Century Music: The “New Art” in France# ars nova Secular music becomes more important than sacred music Composer could specify any rhythmic pattern Beats can be subdivision Syncopation becomes important Leonin and Perotin - measured rhythm, definite time values and rhythms Notation indicated precise rhythms as well as pitches Guillaume de Machaut# Born in French province of Champagne Spent much of his life in the service of many royal families Traveled to many courts and presented his music to various royals Music consists mostly of love songs Mass Ordinary -texts that remain the same from day to day throughout a church year Chapter 2: Music in the Renaissance# 1450-1600 Renaissance idea of the “universal man” Church remains an important patron of music but musical activity gradually shifts to the courts Church choirs grow in size People in positions of power compete for the finest composers and musicians Characteristics of Renaissance Music# Words and Music# Vocal music more important than instrumental music Humanistic interest in language vocal music Close relationship between words and music “Word painting” → Musical depiction of specific words Emotion expressed in a moderate, balanced way, no extreme contrasts of dynamics Texture# Renaissance music is chiefly polyphonic Imitation among the voices is common Homophonic texture with successions of chords is also used Sounds much fuller than medieval music Did not need instrumental accompaniment Rhythm and Melody# Gentle flow than a defined beat Each singer must maintain an individual rhythm Sacred Music in the Renaissance# Motet and the mass are the two forms of Renaissance music Motet Polyphonic choral work set to a sacred Latin text Mass Polyphonic choral composition made up of five sections Josquin Desprez and the Renaissance market# Compositions have masses, motes, and secular vocal pieces Ave Maria Opening uses polyphonic imitation Short melodic phrase is presented by a soprano voice and then imitated in turn by the alto, tenor, and bass Motet- 2,3 or 4 voices can be heard at the same time Duets between high voices imitated by the lower parts Almost homophonic at times Palestrina and the Renaissance Mass# Palestrina music includes 104 and 450 sacred works 1500s and Catholic church was challenged and questioned by the Protestants Jesuit order founded to strengthen the church Convening of the council of Tent considers questions of dogma and organization Church music should be composed to inspire religious contemplation Palestrina\u0026rsquo;s emphasis works reflect an emphasis on more spiritual music Pope Marcellus Mass# Kyrie - rich polyphonic texture Curved melody Upward leaps balanced by downward steps Secular Music in the Renaissance# Vocal Music# Secular music becomes increasingly popular Development of music printing helps to increase the spread of music Music becomes an important leisure activity Renaissance secular music was written for groups of solo voices and for solo voice with the accompaniment of one or more instruments Madrigal - a piece for several solo voices set to a short poem, usually about love Originated during a creative explosion in Italy around 1520 Uses word painting and unusual harmonies more often Thomas Weelkes# Written to Honor Queen Elizabeth Renaissance Lute Song# Lute is a plucked string instrument Lute song cultivated from the late 1590s to the 1620s Mostly homophonic in texture John Dowland# “Flow my Tears” ABC section repeated -

change the melody as it returns later in a piece by changing dynamics, etc. Different movements of a romantic work can be linked together through transitional passages Romantic Composers and Their Public# Composers role in society changed greatly during the time of Beethoven Part of the musicians job had been the composition of works for a specific occasion and audience Bach wrote cantatas for weekly church services One of the first musicians to work freelance This image of Beethoven inspired romantic writers Romantic composers were interested in pleasing those around them and being judged fairly by posterity Free artists by necessity rather than choice Many aristocrats could not afford to have court musicians Romantic composers wrote primarily for a middle class audience Citizens expanded dramatically and people want to hear music First half of the nineteenth century witnessed the founding of music conservatories throughout Europe Captured by virtuosity Private music making also increased during the romantic era Piano becomes a fixture in middle class homes Romantic composers came from the social class that was their main audience It was difficult for children to make a living through music Most composers were forced to work at many areas at work Sonata Form# Sonata form → Refers to the form of a single movement Exposition → Themes are presented\nDevelopment → Themes are treated in new ways\nRecapitulation → Themes return\nExposition First theme in tonic (home) key Bridge containing modulation from home key to new key Second theme in new key Closing section in key of second theme Development New treatment of themes; modulations to different keys Recapitulation First theme in tonic key Bridge Second theme in tonic key Closing section in tonic key Coda In tonic key\nExposition# Strong conflict between the tonic key and the new key Bridge or Transition → leads to the second theme Usually a repeat sign at the end of the exposition in order to indicate if it should be played again Development# Most dramatic section of the movement Rapid modulations and the harmonic tension is heightened Themes are broken into fragments or motives Recapitulation# Brings resolution as we hear the first theme in the tonic key Coda# Powerful feeling of conclusion is attained by following recapitulation with another section Coda rounds off a movement by repeating themes or developing them further Always ends in the tonic key Sonata form is exceptionally flexible and subject to endless variation Viewed as a set of principles that serve to shape and unify contrasts of theme and key Symphony No 40# Controlled agitation in opening Persistence of this rhythmic pattern gives the music a sense of urgency Melody is balanced and symmetrical [msedge_TJoiOBqOh1.png](\u0026lt;https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8147ef02-8109-4add-a936-9c2f026e2ec7/edafeb9c-80df-45b1-9a9c-c95aa23ae7b3/msedge_TJoiOBqOh1.png\u0026gt;) Theme and Variation# Theme and Variations was widely used in the classical period\nA basic musical idea (theme) is repeated over and over and is changed each time A\n1(A’)\n2(A’’)\n3(A’’’)\n$$\ra^1,a^2,a^3,etc.\r$$\nEach variation is unique\nUsually same length as the theme Changes of melody, rhythm, harmony, accompaniment, dynamics, or tone color Core melody may appear in the bass or it may be repeated in a diff key Composer might invent an original melody or use someone else\nMinuet and Trio# Often used as the third movement in classical symphonies\nFirst appeared at Court of Louis XIV\nMovement of a symphony is written for listening, not dancing\nIt is in triple meter 3/4 ABA form Minuet- A\nTrio -

special unaccompanied showpiece for the soloist Orchestra suspends forward motion by briefly sustaining a dissonant chord Suspense announces the entry of the soloists cadenza Soloist usually improvised the cadenzas Performers of eighteenth century concertos have a choice of cadenzas Own performance or that of a student Best when a style matches concerto Best when their style matches that of the concerto A classical concerto begins with a movement in sonata form of a special king, containing two expositions Orchestra plays which represents home key Second exposition is soloists first notes Could be powerful or quiet - dramatic because suspense has been built Classical Chamber Music# Designed for intimate setting rather than a public concert hall Performed by small group of 2 to 9 One player to a part Lighter in sound than classical orchestral music Fashionable for an aristocrat or a member of the well-to do middle class to play chamber music with friends and to hir professional musicians to entertain guests Subtle and intimate- please the performer and the listener Group is a team Each member is essential Give and take is called for among the string instruments Does not need a conductor- listen to each other and adjust String Quartet 2 violins, a viola and a cello Modeled after a conversation between four intelligent individuals Four movements: Fast Slow Minuet or Scherzo Fast Sonata for violin and piano is another popular form Much chamber music is performed by amateurs Joseph Haydn# Born in Austrian village called Rohrau Musical background consisted of folksongs and peasant dances At age 8- he went to Vienna to serve as a choirboy in the Cathedral of St Stephen Voice changed Gave lessons to children Entered the service of Esterhazys- Richest and most powerful of the Hungarian noble families Compose all music requested by patron Conduct orchestra Oversee instruments and the music library As an individual Haydn was good humored Conscientious about his duties 1795- Return to Vienna rich and honored Choruses and Orchestras were formed for the sole purpose of performing them Died in 1809 Haydn’s music# Pathfinder for the classical style Mozart and Beethoven were influenced by his style Music is robust and direct Most of it has a folk flavor Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart# Wrote a symphony at age 8 Oratorio at 11 Opera at 12 Mozart\u0026rsquo;s father was eager to show him off- continuously on tour until about age 15 Mozart won more acclaim as a boy than as an adult He could not tolerate being treated like a servant in Saulsbury Traveled to Vienna Mozart was more successful in his last year and tried to complete the requiem for a mass of the dead Mozart Music# The most versatile of all composers Wrote masterpieces of the all the musical forms of his time- symphonies, string quartets, piano concertos and operas Ludwig van Beethoven# Born in Bonn, Germany Serving as assistant to the court organist Several piano compositions published Played for Mozart at 16 Studied with Haydn in Vienna where he spent the rest of his life City dazzled by his virtuosity and moved by his improvisations Three nobleman committed themselves to give him an annual income as long as he was in Vienna Beethoven felt the first symptoms of Deafness in 1802 Discussed the mental issues that he encountered Often dressed sloppily and fell in and out of love with women By the time he was 44 he was unable to effectively conduct an orchestra due to his lack of hearing "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/semester-1/mu-100/part-5/","title":"Part 5","section":"MU 100","content":"Chapter 5# The Art song (lied)# Art sing is a composition for solo voice and piano Accompaniment is a integral part of the composers concept Original meant to be sung at home, not at concert halls Poetry and music are fused in the art song -

However, her father limited Fanny\u0026rsquo;s musical ambitions by saying that as an upper-class young woman she could never aspire to be a professional musician like her brother Felix: \u0026ldquo;Music will perhaps be his profession, whilst for you it can only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing.\u0026rdquo; Even her beloved brother Felix agreed with their father and discouraged Fanny from publishing her compositions. In 1826, two of her songs were published together with four songs by Felix under his name. Years later Felix visited Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace and accompanied her as she sang a song she thought was by him. After the Queen praised the song, Felix admitted to her that it was composed by his sister. When she was twenty-three, Fanny married Wilhelm Hensel, painter at the court in Berlin, who encouraged her musical activities. The couple\u0026rsquo;s only child was named Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel after Fanny\u0026rsquo;s favorite composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Felix Mendelssohn. In 1831, Fanny became music director and performer at Sunday concerts in the Mendelssohn family mansion, reviving the musicales her parents had hosted years before. Fanny\u0026rsquo;s concerts were attended by up to 200 invited guests from Berlin\u0026rsquo;s elite. The works heard included compositions ranging from Bach to Chopin, and guest performers included such famous virtuosos as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. In 1846, persuaded by praise from musicians, Fanny wrote in her diary, \u0026ldquo;I have made up my mind to publish my things.\u0026rdquo; To Felix she wrote: \u0026ldquo;I am as afraid of you my brother at age 40 as I was of Father at age 14\u0026hellip;1 hope I won\u0026rsquo;t disgrace all of you through my publishing.\u0026rdquo; Felix replied giving Fanny his \u0026ldquo;professional blessing on your decision to join our guild.\u0026rdquo; Several of her works finally appeared in print under her name, but less than a year later, in 1847 at age forty-one, Fanny died of a stroke.\nProgram Music# Romantic composers were particularly attracted to program music- music associate with a story, poem, idea or scene Fantastic Symphony Romeo and Juliet Moldau Hector Berlioz# One of the first romantic composers and a daring creator of new orchestral sounds Born in a small town near Grenoble Originally was supposed to study medicine in Paris Studied at the Paris Conservatory, composed and went to the Opera House Liked the works of Shakespeare Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Music# Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky# Antonin Dvorak# Johannes Brahms# Romantic who breathed new life into classical forms Georges Bizet# Giuseppe Verdi# Giacomo Puccini# Richard Wagner# "}]
