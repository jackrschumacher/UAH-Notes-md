<meta name="description" content="Asymmetric Informaiton# Asymmetric information Information available to buyers and sellers differs In a market with asymmetric information, buyers and sellers have different information about the good being traded. In a market with asymmetric information a good is said to have hidden characteristics if the buyer or the seller observes something about the good that the other does not. In the car market, the seller of the car knows more about the car than the buyer Hidden characteristics One side observes something about the good being transacted that is both relevant and not observed by the other party Hidden actions When one side takes action that are relevant for but not observed by the other party If the information gaps are large enough - possible for a market to completely shut down, even if there may be possible gains Adverse selection One agent in a transaction about a hidden characteristic of a good and decides whether to participate in the transaction on the basis of the information Can be solved in the market by using signaling Example: high-risk and low-risk individuals Health insurance will attract a disproportionate number of high-risk individuals These are the individuals health insurance companies do not want to attract! Therefore: Healthier people decide that it is not worth it to pay the extra price for the expensive healthcare plans- therefore the percentage of unhealthy people on the most expensive plans increases 80 percent of the total number of people in Genovia with health insurance are more than 40 years old. Signaling An action that an individual with private information takes in order to convince others about his information Asymmetric information Examples# $2,500 will only buy the lemon in this case But you don’t want to buy a lemon! If the seller accepts your $2,500 and you know that this is the outcome of asymmetric information, you won’t buy the car $2,500 will only buy the lemon in this case But you don’t want to buy a lemon! If the seller accepts your $2,500 and you know that this is the outcome of asymmetric information, you won’t buy the car Example: Why cars lose a lot of value when they are driven off of the lot Because we do not know much about the person who is buying the car and do not know how they would treat it Additional definitions# Principal-agent relationship Principal designs a contract specifying payments to the agent as a function of his or her performance, and the agent takes an action that influences performance and thus the payment of the principal amount The principal provides incentives for another party to work on the principal’s benefit Moral hazard Actions that are taken by one party but are relevant for and not observed by the other party in the transaction Example: people with air bags in their cars are more likely to get into accidents. Why? Two explanations 1. Adverse selection—if you know that you are a bad driver, you are more likely to choose a car that has air bags. 2. Moral hazard—if you are protected from some of the risk of driving, you are more likely to drive recklessly. An employee in a department store often steals goods when other employees are not around. Because the store does not have a surveillance​ camera, the store manager is unable to monitor his activities. Jane started eating more junk food and taking less care of her health after she bought a life insurance plan.
