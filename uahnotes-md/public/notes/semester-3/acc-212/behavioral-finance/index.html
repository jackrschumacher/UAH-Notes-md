Cognitive errors &amp; emotional biases# Cognitive errors# Belief Perseverance (Core)# Description# Tendency to maintain a belief despite evidence that contradicts your beleif Example# Continuing belief in the honestly of a political candidate after clear evidence of corruption Confirmation Bias# Description# Seeking, interpreting, recalling information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs but ignoring conflicting data Example# Smoker only reading studies that downplay the health risks of smoking Conservatism bias# Description# Insufficiently revising beliefs in response to new evidence-sticking too closely to priors Key examples# An investor slightly downgrading a stock despite strong negative signals Favoring traditional candidates Keeping a feature in a product that users do not like/or isn’t working Representativeness bias# Description# Judging probability by similarity to a prototype, ignoring base rates or disconfirming evidence Key examples# Assuming a shy person is a librarian, not a salesperson despite base-rate odds Judging people based on their appearance Illusion of Control Bias# Description# Overestimating one’s ability to control or influence outcomes that are actually determined by chance or external factors-reinforcing belief in personal theories despite evidence of randomness Key examples# A gambler believing they can “will” a slot machine win or that rituals improve luck, even after repeated losses Or continuing to gamble believing that you will eventually win even though it is statistically unlikely Hindsight Bias# Description# Tendency to see past events as having been predictable (I knew along) after they occur, reinforcing overconfidence in initial beliefs and resisting revision Key example# After a market crash- “I knew it was going to crash”, even if the pre-crash predictions were optimistic Processing Errors# Anchoring and Adjustment Bias# Description# Over-relying on the first piece of information (the anchor) when making decisions, the insufficiently adjusting from it Key example# Asked “Is the Mississippi River longer than 500 miles?” then estimating 600 miles; if asked “longer than 5,000 miles?”, estimating 4,000 miles—even though actual length is —2,300 miles. Mental Accounting bias# Description# Treating money differently depending on its source, intended use, or mental account, rather than fungibility Key example# Refusing to use a $100 tax refund for groceries (seen as “extra”) but freely spending $100 from salary; or keeping a “vacation fund” separate from daily expenses. Framing bias# Description# Making different decisions based on how information is presented (gain vs loss frame), even if objective facts are identical Key example# 95% survival rate → people choose surgery; 5% mortality rate → people avoid it—even though both mean the same outcome. Availability Bias# Description# Judging likelihood or frequency by how easily examples come to mind, rather than actual data Key example# After seeing news about shark attacks, overestimating the risk of swimming; or fearing plane crashes more than car accidents due to vivid media coverage. Behavioral biases# Loss-Aversion Bias# Description# The pain of a loss is twice as much as the pleasure of a similar gain; therefore we prefer to avoid losses over acquiring gains Key example# Reusing to sell a stock down $1,000 in order to avoid realizing the loss, but not buying more of the stock when it is up $1,000 Disposition effect# Description# Selling winning investments to soon in order to lock in gains, and holding losing investments too long to avoid realizing losses Key example# An investor quickly sells a stock up 20% but holds one down 20% hoping it comes back Overconfidence Bias# Description# Overestimating one’s own knowledge, predictive ability, or control over outcomes Key example# A trader believing they can beat the market consistently despite average returns; or a driver claiming “I’m above average” (statistically impossible for most). Self-Control bias# Description# Prioritizing short-term gratification over long term goals due to impulsivity and a lack of discipline Key example# Spending a bonus on a luxury item instead of saving for retirement Eating dessert despite a diet plan Status Quo bias# Description# Preferring things to stay the same Resisting change even when a new option is better Key example# Refusing to sell a family heirloom for $5,000 even though you wouldn’t buy it for a lower amount Regret-Aversion bias# Description# Avoiding decisions that might lead to regret, even if rationally optimal Fear of being wrong Key example# Not investing in a stock that later surges or not selling a stock that crashes ">
