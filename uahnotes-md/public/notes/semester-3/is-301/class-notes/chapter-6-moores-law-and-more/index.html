<meta name="description" content=" Moore’s Law: Chip performance per dollar doubles every eighteen months. Microprocessor: The part of the computer that executes the instructions of a computer program. Latency: In computing, latency means delay. Low-latency tasks have less delay, so they are faster. Random-access memory (RAM): The fast, chip-based volatile storage in a computing device. Volatile memory: Storage (such as RAM chips) that is wiped clean when power is cut off from a device. Nonvolatile memory: Storage that retains data even when powered down (such as flash memory, hard disc, or DVD storage). Flash memory: Nonvolatile, chip-based storage, often used in mobile phones, cameras, and MP3 players. Sometimes called flash RAM, flash memory is slower than conventional RAM but holds its charge even when the power goes out. Solid state electronics: Semiconductor-based devices. Solid state components often suffer fewer failures and require less energy than mechanical counterparts because they have no moving parts. RAM, flash memory, and microprocessors are solid state devices. Hard drives are not. SSD: Solid state drive- a chip based, novolatile storage device. Semiconductors: A substance such as silicon dioxide used inside most computer chips that is capable of enabling as well as inhibiting the flow of electricity. From a managerial perspective, when someone refers to semiconductors, they are talking about computer chips, and the semiconductor industry is the chip business. Optical fiber line: A high-speed glass or plastic-lined networking cable used in telecommunications. Price elasticity: The rate at which the demand for a product or service fluctuates with price change. Goods and services that are highly price elastic (e.g., most consumer electronics) see demand spike as prices drop, whereas goods and services that are less price elastic are less responsive to price change (think heart surgery). Internet of Things (IoT): A vision where low-cost sensors, processors, and communication are embedded into a wide array of products and our environment, allowing a vast network to collect data, analyze input, and automatically coordinate collective action. Fabs: Semiconductor fabrication facilities; the multibillion-dollar plants used to manufacture semiconductors. Silicon wafers: A thin, circular slice of material used to create semiconductor devices. Hundreds of chips may be etched on a single wafer, where they are eventually cut out for individual packaging. Multicore microprocessors: Microprocessors with two or more (typically lower power) calculating processor cores on the same piece of silicon. Supercomputers: Computers that are among the fastest of any in the world at the time of their introduction. Massively parallel: Computers designed with many microprocessors that work together, simultaneously, to solve problems. Grid computing: A type of computing that uses special software to enable several, often idle computers to work together on a common problem, as if they were a massively parallel supercomputer. Cluster computing: Connecting server computers via software and networking so that their resources can be used to collectively solve computing tasks. Software as a service (SaaS): A form of cloud computing where a firm subscribes to a third-party software and receives a service that is delivered online. Cloud computing: Replacing computing resources—either an organization’s or individual’s hardware or software—with services provided over the Internet. Server farms: A massive network of computer servers running software to coordinate their collective use. Server farms provide the infrastructure backbone to SaaS and hardware cloud efforts, as well as many large-scale Internet services. E-waste: Discarded, often obsolete technology; also known as electronic waste. ">

  <article class="markdown book-article"><ul>
<li><strong>Moore’s Law:</strong> Chip performance per dollar doubles every eighteen months.
<ul>
<li><strong>Microprocessor:</strong> The part of the computer that executes the instructions of a computer program.</li>
<li><strong>Latency:</strong> In computing, latency means delay. Low-latency tasks have less delay, so they are faster.</li>
<li><strong>Random-access memory (RAM):</strong> The fast, chip-based volatile storage in a computing device.</li>
<li><strong>Volatile memory:</strong> Storage (such as RAM chips) that is wiped clean when power is cut off from a device.</li>
<li><strong>Nonvolatile memory:</strong> Storage that retains data even when powered down (such as flash memory, hard disc, or DVD storage).</li>
<li><strong>Flash memory:</strong> Nonvolatile, chip-based storage, often used in mobile phones, cameras, and MP3 players. Sometimes called flash RAM, flash memory is slower than conventional RAM but holds its charge even when the power goes out.</li>
<li><strong>Solid state electronics:</strong> Semiconductor-based devices. Solid state components often suffer fewer failures and require less energy than mechanical counterparts because they have no moving parts. RAM, flash memory, and microprocessors are solid state devices. Hard drives are not.</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> Solid state drive- a chip based, novolatile storage device.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> A substance such as silicon dioxide used inside most computer chips that is capable of enabling as well as inhibiting the flow of electricity. From a managerial perspective, when someone refers to semiconductors, they are talking about computer chips, and the semiconductor industry is the chip business.</li>
<li><strong>Optical fiber line:</strong> A high-speed glass or plastic-lined networking cable used in telecommunications.</li>
<li><strong>Price elasticity:</strong> The rate at which the demand for a product or service fluctuates with price change. Goods and services that are highly price elastic (e.g., most consumer electronics) see demand spike as prices drop, whereas goods and services that are less price elastic are less responsive to price change (think heart surgery).</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> A vision where low-cost sensors, processors, and communication are embedded into a wide array of products and our environment, allowing a vast network to collect data, analyze input, and automatically coordinate collective action.</li>
<li><strong>Fabs:</strong> Semiconductor fabrication facilities; the multibillion-dollar plants used to manufacture semiconductors.</li>
<li><strong>Silicon wafers:</strong> A thin, circular slice of material used to create semiconductor devices. Hundreds of chips may be etched on a single wafer, where they are eventually cut out for individual packaging.</li>
<li><strong>Multicore microprocessors:</strong> Microprocessors with two or more (typically lower power) calculating processor cores on the same piece of silicon.</li>
<li><strong>Supercomputers:</strong> Computers that are among the fastest of any in the world at the time of their introduction.</li>
<li><strong>Massively parallel:</strong> Computers designed with many microprocessors that work together, simultaneously, to solve problems.</li>
<li><strong>Grid computing:</strong> A type of computing that uses special software to enable several, often idle computers to work together on a common problem, as if they were a massively parallel supercomputer.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster computing:</strong> Connecting server computers via software and networking so that their resources can be used to collectively solve computing tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Software as a service (SaaS):</strong> A form of cloud computing where a firm subscribes to a third-party software and receives a service that is delivered online.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud computing:</strong> Replacing computing resources—either an organization’s or individual’s hardware or software—with services provided over the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Server farms:</strong> A massive network of computer servers running software to coordinate their collective use. Server farms provide the infrastructure backbone to SaaS and hardware cloud efforts, as well as many large-scale Internet services.</li>
<li><strong>E-waste:</strong> Discarded, often obsolete technology; also known as electronic waste.</li>
