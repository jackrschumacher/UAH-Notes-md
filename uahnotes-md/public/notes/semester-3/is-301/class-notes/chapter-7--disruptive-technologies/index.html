<meta name="description" content=" Disruptive innovations: Don’t need to perform better than incumbents, they simply need to perform well enough to appeal to the customers of the incumbents (and often do so at a lower price). Why do large firms sometimes fail?: Large firms often do not see new technologies as adding value to their business, and therefore do not invest in the innovation. How can a firm recognize potentially disruptive technology?: Pay attention to the trajectory of fast and cheap technological advancement as well as new and emerging technology. It’s important to converse with those on the experimental edge of technology. Transition costs: Even for firms that are well armed for a battle with an emergent and disruptive newcomer, a transition from old models to new can be costly. Additive manufacturing: A type of industrial 3D printing where material is built up, layer by layer, as material is progressively added to shape an object. Bitcoin: An open source, decentralized payment system (sometimes controversially referred to as a digital, virtual, or cryptocurrency) that operates in a peer-to-peer environment, without bank or central authority. Cryptocurrency: A digital asset where a secure form of mathematics (cryptography) is used to handle transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies usually take advantage of a technology known as a blockchain. Blockchain: A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down. DeFi: A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down. CBDC: A digital form of a government-issued currency. Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to a currency or commodity, rather than have currency value float independently. Crypto benefits: It’s often thought that cryptocurrencies could be a boon for international commerce, especially for cross-border remittance and in expanding e-commerce in emerging markets. Consumer benefit: For cryptocurrencies, consumer benefit needs to be stronger. ">

  <article class="markdown book-article"><ul>
<li><strong>Disruptive innovations:</strong> Don&rsquo;t need to perform better than incumbents, they simply need to perform well enough to appeal to the customers of the incumbents (and often do so at a lower price).
<ul>
<li><strong>Why do large firms sometimes fail?:</strong> Large firms often do not see new technologies as adding value to their business, and therefore do not invest in the innovation.</li>
<li><strong>How can a firm recognize potentially disruptive technology?:</strong> Pay attention to the trajectory of fast and cheap technological advancement as well as new and emerging technology. It&rsquo;s important to converse with those on the experimental edge of technology.</li>
<li><strong>Transition costs:</strong> Even for firms that are well armed for a battle with an emergent and disruptive newcomer, a transition from old models to new can be costly.</li>
<li><strong>Additive manufacturing:</strong> A type of industrial 3D printing where material is built up, layer by layer, as material is progressively added to shape an object.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> An open source, decentralized payment system (sometimes controversially referred to as a digital, virtual, or cryptocurrency) that operates in a peer-to-peer environment, without bank or central authority.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> A digital asset where a secure form of mathematics (cryptography) is used to handle transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies usually take advantage of a technology known as a blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down.</li>
<li><strong>DeFi:</strong> A distributed and decentralized ledger that records and verifies transactions and ownership, making it difficult to tamper with or shut down.</li>
<li><strong>CBDC:</strong> A digital form of a government-issued currency.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to a currency or commodity, rather than have currency value float independently.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto benefits:</strong> It’s often thought that cryptocurrencies could be a boon for international commerce, especially for cross-border remittance and in expanding e-commerce in emerging markets.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer benefit:</strong> For cryptocurrencies, consumer benefit needs to be stronger.</li>
