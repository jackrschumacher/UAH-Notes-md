</blockquote><p>At thirteen, in honor of her father&rsquo;s birthday, Fanny played from memory all the twenty-four Preludes
from Bach&rsquo;s The Well-Tempered Clavier, and at fourteen, composed songs and piano pieces. However,
her father limited Fanny&rsquo;s musical ambitions by saying that as an upper-class young woman she could
never aspire to be a professional musician like her brother Felix: &ldquo;Music will perhaps be his profession,
whilst for you it can only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing.&rdquo; Even her beloved
brother Felix agreed with their father and discouraged Fanny from publishing her compositions.
In 1826, two of her songs were published together with four songs by Felix under his name. Years later
Felix visited Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace and accompanied her as she sang a song she
thought was by him. After the Queen praised the song, Felix admitted to her that it was composed by
his sister.
When she was twenty-three, Fanny married Wilhelm Hensel, painter at the court in Berlin, who
encouraged her musical activities. The couple&rsquo;s only child was named Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel
after Fanny&rsquo;s favorite composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Felix
Mendelssohn. In 1831, Fanny became music director and performer at Sunday concerts in the
Mendelssohn family mansion, reviving the musicales her parents had hosted years before. Fanny&rsquo;s
concerts were attended by up to 200 invited guests from Berlin&rsquo;s elite.
The works heard included compositions ranging from Bach to Chopin, and guest performers included
such famous virtuosos as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt.
In 1846, persuaded by praise from musicians, Fanny wrote in her diary, &ldquo;I have made up my mind to
publish my things.&rdquo; To Felix she wrote: &ldquo;I am as afraid of you my brother at age 40 as I was of Father at
age 14&hellip;1 hope I won&rsquo;t disgrace all of you through my publishing.&rdquo; Felix replied giving Fanny his
&ldquo;professional blessing on your decision to join our guild.&rdquo; Several of her works finally appeared in print
under her name, but less than a year later, in 1847 at age forty-one, Fanny died of a stroke.</p>
