Product mix decision Compare the gross profit of two products and sell the product with the greatest gross profit to maximize total gross profit, considering limited production capabilities To determine which products are the most profitable, company controller recomputes total manufacturing costs and gross profit for standard and premium models Cost management decisions# Companies adopt ABC to get more accurate product costs for pricing and product mix decisions Value engineering reevaluates activities to reduce costs while satisfying customer needs Cross-functional teams including marketers, engineers, production personnel, and accountants, work together Target Pricing Target price is the amount customers are willing to pay for a product or service The target cost is the maximum cost to develop, produce and deliver the product or service and earn the desired profit Cost-based pricing The full product cost is the cost to develop, produce and deliver the product or service Desired profit is added to this full product cost to determine sales price Just in time management systems?# Reduces inventory costs Raw materials and finished goods are completed just in time for delivery to customers Cost of buying, storing and moving inventory can be significant to companies Using a quality management system?# System that helps managers improve the business\u0026rsquo;s performance by providing quality products and services is called a quality management system Goals of the system are: Improve performance Increase customer satisfaction Increase profit Four types of Quality costs Prevention costs- Costs incurred to avoid poor quality goods or services Appraisal costs- Costs incurred to detect poor-quality materials, goods, or services Internal failure costs- Costs incurred to correct goods or services before delivery to customers External failure costs- Costs incurred after delivery to the customer has occured How activity-based management be used in service companies?# Same steps as used for manufacturing companies Identify activities and estimate their total indirect costs Identify the allocation base for each activity and estimate the total quantity of each allocation base Compute the predetermined overhead allocation rate for each activity Allocate indirect costs to the cost object Just in time costing# Tracks costs after the units are completed It combines Raw Materials Inventory and Work in Process Inventory- Raw and In process inventory The conversion costs account combines direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs Recording Transactions in Just-in-Time costing# "},{"id":1,"href":"/notes/semester-3/acc-212/behavioral-finance/","title":"Behavioral Finance","section":"ACC 212","content":"Example behavioral finance graph# \u0026ldquo;I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of men.\u0026rdquo;\nCognitive errors \u0026amp; emotional biases# Cognitive errors# Belief Perseverance (Core)# Description# Tendency to maintain a belief despite evidence that contradicts your beleif Example# Continuing belief in the honestly of a political candidate after clear evidence of corruption Confirmation Bias# Description# Seeking, interpreting, recalling information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs but ignoring conflicting data Example# Smoker only reading studies that downplay the health risks of smoking Conservatism bias# Description# Insufficiently revising beliefs in response to new evidence-sticking too closely to priors Key examples# An investor slightly downgrading a stock despite strong negative signals Favoring traditional candidates Keeping a feature in a product that users do not like/or isn\u0026rsquo;t working Representativeness bias# Description# Judging probability by similarity to a prototype, ignoring base rates or disconfirming evidence Key examples# Assuming a shy person is a librarian, not a salesperson despite base-rate odds Judging people based on their appearance Illusion of Control Bias# Description# Overestimating one\u0026rsquo;s ability to control or influence outcomes that are actually determined by chance or external factors-reinforcing belief in personal theories despite evidence of randomness Key examples# A gambler believing they can \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo; a slot machine win or that rituals improve luck, even after repeated losses Or continuing to gamble believing that you will eventually win even though it is statistically unlikely Hindsight Bias# Description# Tendency to see past events as having been predictable (I knew along) after they occur, reinforcing overconfidence in initial beliefs and resisting revision Key example# After a market crash- \u0026ldquo;I knew it was going to crash\u0026rdquo;, even if the pre-crash predictions were optimistic Processing Errors# Anchoring and Adjustment Bias# Description# Over-relying on the first piece of information (the anchor) when making decisions, the insufficiently adjusting from it Key example# Asked \u0026ldquo;Is the Mississippi River longer than 500 miles?\u0026rdquo; then estimating 600 miles; if asked \u0026ldquo;longer than 5,000 miles?\u0026rdquo;, estimating 4,000 miles—even though actual length is —2,300 miles. Mental Accounting bias# Description# Treating money differently depending on its source, intended use, or mental account, rather than fungibility Key example# Refusing to use a $100 tax refund for groceries (seen as \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo;) but freely spending $100 from salary; or keeping a \u0026ldquo;vacation fund\u0026rdquo; separate from daily expenses. Framing bias# Description# Making different decisions based on how information is presented (gain vs loss frame), even if objective facts are identical Key example# 95% survival rate → people choose surgery; 5% mortality rate → people avoid it—even though both mean the same outcome. Availability Bias# Description# Judging likelihood or frequency by how easily examples come to mind, rather than actual data Key example# After seeing news about shark attacks, overestimating the risk of swimming; or fearing plane crashes more than car accidents due to vivid media coverage. Behavioral biases# Loss-Aversion Bias# Description# The pain of a loss is twice as much as the pleasure of a similar gain; therefore we prefer to avoid losses over acquiring gains Key example# Reusing to sell a stock down $1,000 in order to avoid realizing the loss, but not buying more of the stock when it is up $1,000 Disposition effect# Description# Selling winning investments to soon in order to lock in gains, and holding losing investments too long to avoid realizing losses Key example# An investor quickly sells a stock up 20% but holds one down 20% hoping it comes back Overconfidence Bias# Description# Overestimating one\u0026rsquo;s own knowledge, predictive ability, or control over outcomes Key example# A trader believing they can beat the market consistently despite average returns; or a driver claiming \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m above average\u0026rdquo; (statistically impossible for most). Self-Control bias# Description# Prioritizing short-term gratification over long term goals due to impulsivity and a lack of discipline Key example# Spending a bonus on a luxury item instead of saving for retirement Eating dessert despite a diet plan Status Quo bias# Description# Preferring things to stay the same Resisting change even when a new option is better Key example# Refusing to sell a family heirloom for $5,000 even though you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy it for a lower amount Regret-Aversion bias# Description# Avoiding decisions that might lead to regret, even if rationally optimal Fear of being wrong Key example# Not investing in a stock that later surges or not selling a stock that crashes "},{"id":2,"href":"/notes/semester-3/acc-212/job-order-costing/","title":"Job Order

The Trojan war This war took place approx 4 years before the piece was written We start in the middle of the war Talks of the flood-almost like in Gilgamesh Couple spared in the flood and tasked with repopulating the earth through throwing stones (the bones of the earth) Troy is the western coast of Turkey Several layers have been excavated in this region discovering cities (9) Some evidence of war in this region from excavations The Hittite kingdom was located near the East of the Troy - can easily make cultural references/connection The Trojan war is started by the Judgement of Paris in which he chooses Aphrodite for love over two other Goddesses, Athena and Hera/ Paris seduced Helen, wife of Spartan Lord Menelaus. Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother Agamemnon. The content of the poem centers around Achilles, the greatest warrior of Agamemnon\u0026rsquo;s forces Angered the god Apollo by kidnapping Chryseis- the daughter of the high priest Chryses Forced to give up this woman, Agamemnon takes Achilles concubine Briseis in return, angering Achilles and provoking the warrior to “sit out” the war. He will return Achilles is accidentally killed Tension in this poem is that of the immortality of the gods and the mortality of the humans Achilles must reconcile himself to his own mortality Gods have to recognize just how much they’ve become- involved and immersed in human activity Gilgamesh and the Iliad have many similarities The Trojan horse The Odyssey Multiple narratorial perspectives, Odysseus tells his story in the first person in the middle. Dactylic Hexameter is a line of poetry with six metrical feet (one strong stress and two weak stresses) Major spaces: The main hall of Odyseeus kingdom Coming of age, growing old The collateral of war Wit and intellect over sheer fore Arbitrary acts of the gods and the powerlessness of humanity The Odyssey# Books 1-8# We start with summary of the whole: \u0026ldquo;He came to see / many people\u0026rsquo;s cities, where he learned their customs, / while on the sea his spirit suffered many torments\u0026rdquo; (1.3-5)] Almost like a muse We begin with an assembly of the gods, with Zeus and Athena speaking (Athena loves Odysseus for his cunning and his battle prowess) Zeus: \u0026ldquo;How could I forget godlike Odysseus, / pre-eminent among all mortal men for his intelligence and offerings / to the mortal gods\u0026rdquo; (1.66-68) Some linkage to the Illiad The gods will send Hermes, the messenger god, to Calypso, who holds Odysseus on her island (he\u0026rsquo;s been there seven years) Athena goes to Ithaca, to Odysseus\u0026rsquo; palace where his son, Telemachus must entertain suitors to his mother (vying for her hand in marriage with Odysseus gone so long and presumed dead). Note the **hospitality **of Telemachus to the disguised goddess; hospitality is a significant theme in this text, so obsessed with feasting! Notice the contrast between Telemachus and the suitors. Notice too how the bard Phemius performs a song of Achaeans returning from Troy (but Penelope stops him from singing that \u0026ldquo;painful song\u0026rdquo; (1.276). Odysseus is a poor young man Hospitality is a central theme of the text and the culture as a whole The idea that when aiding a stranger, you actually might be aiding a god or gods in disguise- you may be rewarded for your actions- so be kind Telemachus is angry with all the suitors- Athena advises Telemachus to sail off and seek the word of his father (King Nestor in Pylos and the to Menelaus in Sparta) “\u0026ldquo;If you think it\u0026rsquo;s better and would prefer / that one man\u0026rsquo;s livelihood should be consumed / without paying anything, I\u0026rsquo;ll call on / the immortal gods to see if mighty Zeus / will bring about an act of retribution\u0026rdquo; (1.319-23)” \u0026ldquo;Telemachus spoke, then threw the scepter on the ground / and burst out crying\u0026rdquo; (2.52-53). Wily Penelope quote about the suitors- sounds similar to her husband Odysseus \u0026ldquo;you [suitors] must wait, / although you are keen for me to marry, / till I complete this cloak—for if I don\u0026rsquo;t, / my weaving would be wasted and in vain\u0026rdquo; (2.74-77) [but, after four years, she is betrayed by one of her women] Female characters are shown throughout the text weaving (including Athena)- a metaphor for how the narrative of the story is being shaped and spun over time Betrayed by a female servant who thus ends her resistance to the suitors (cant stop them) Athena roams Ithaca in disguise as Telemachus to recruit sailors for him in order to ensure that he is able to depart in a swift manner In Book 3 (omitted from your books), Telemachus will sail to Peleponnese (southern Greece) and journey by land to the city of Pylos where he will be entertained by his father\u0026rsquo;s old comrade, King Nestor. The King offers his own account of the battles at Troy and his return home to Pylos. The King will send Telemachus on, further, to Sparta to see Menelaus. Nestor\u0026rsquo;s son, Pisistratus (same name as later Athenian ruler) will accompany Telemachus. Telemachus compares the Hall of Menelaus to Zeus’s kingdom- and is corrected by Minnelaus: \u0026ldquo;No man alive could rival Zeus, dear boys, / with his everlasting palace and possessions\u0026rdquo; (4.87-88). Meleanus grieves for Odyseus and recognizes Telemachus by his resemblance to his father Helen\u0026rsquo;s and Menelaus\u0026rsquo; account of Odysseus sneaking into Troy as a beggar and, then, the Trojan Horse: \u0026ldquo;We heard you [Helen] call. / Two of us—Diomedes and myself—were eager to get up and charge outside / or else to answer back from where we sat, in side the horse. But Odysseus stopped us—/we wished to speak, but he held us in check\u0026rdquo; (4.86-90) Helen admits that she might have been drugged in Troy We are reminded of the characters own mortality Athena appeals to the gods to aid Odysseus, who is still trapped on the island with Calypso and has been for 7 years. Athena describes the ambush that is being set for Telemachus. Hermes goes to Calypso to tell her that Odysseus must leave the island. Further establishes the theme of mortality vs immortality Odysseus sits regularly by the sea \u0026ldquo;his eyes always full of tears / because he was squandering his sweet life, mourning / for his return\u0026rdquo; (5.100-103).\nOdysseus is Desperate for immortality\nMonsters stand at the threshold of becoming \u0026ldquo;Monsters ask us how we perceive our world and \u0026ldquo;how we have misrepresented what we have attempted to place.\u0026rdquo; Odysseus starts to embrace his humanity and mortality Odysseus has to leave the island and must build his own boat in order to leave it Reminded of what it means to be a mortal in the realm of the gods However, Poseidon (Sea god) makes his journey difficult and Odysseus ends up washed up on the the shores of Paheacia \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s trouble! In this country I have reached, what are the people like? Are they violent and untamed, without a sense of justice? Or are they kind to strangers? In their minds do they fear the gods?” Book 7: Odysseus appears with the queen of the Phoenicians, Arete, and her husband King Alcinous Oyssedeus asks for kindness from the queen Another example of hospitality and sanctuary Alcinous: \u0026ldquo;If he\u0026rsquo;s a deathless one come down from heaven, / then gods are planning something different. / So far they\u0026rsquo;ve always shown themselves to us / in their true form\u0026rdquo; (7.78-80) They think that Ossyedus may have been sent from the gods However, Odysseus explains that he is mortal and not a god “I’m like mortal men. Indeed, I could recount a longer story, all those hardships I have had to suffer.” (To Alcinous) \u0026ldquo;After they enjoyed their heart\u0026rsquo;s fill of food and drink, the minstrel Demodocus, inspired by the Muse, sang about the glorious deeds of warriors, that story, whose fame had climbed to spacious heaven, about Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus, when, at a lavish feat in honor of the gods, they fought each other in ferocious argument\u0026rdquo; (8.34-40) Get a glimpse into the Greek Culture Another feast occurs between Aphrodite and and Ares which Hephaestus (Vulcan) learns about and is embarrassed and angry “\u0026ldquo;Nasty deeds don\u0026rsquo;t pay. / The slow one overtakes the swift just as / Hephaestus, slow as he is, has caught Ares, / although of all gods who hold Olympus / he\u0026rsquo;s the fastest one there is. Yes, he\u0026rsquo;s lame, / but he\u0026rsquo;s a crafty one\u0026rdquo; (124-29). The tortoise and the hare type of situation \u0026ldquo;He sang about the various ways those warriors / laid waste that lofty town [Troy] and how Odysseus, / like Ares, god of war, and noble Menelaus / went to the home of Deiphobus [Trojan prince], where, he said / Odysseus battled in the most horrendous fight, / from which he then emerged at last victorious\u0026rdquo; (8.249-54) Omitted text from my edition: \u0026ldquo;That was the song the famous harper sang / but great Odysseus melted into tears, / \u0026hellip; / as a woman weeps, her arms flung around her darling husband, / a man who fell in battle, fighting for town and townsman, / trying to beat the day of doom from home and children. / Seeing the man go down, dying, gasping for breath, / she clings for dear life, screams and shrills—/ but the victors, just behind her, / digging spear-butts into her back and shoulders, / drag her off in bondage, yoked to hard labor, pain, / and the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks. / So from Odysseus\u0026rsquo; eyes ran tears of heartbreak now.\u0026rdquo; Oyssedus ponders his actions, killing,etc. Book 9: Odysseus becomes the bard and the storyteller \u0026ldquo;now I\u0026rsquo;ll speak / of the unhappy journey back which Zeus / arranged for me when I returned from war\u0026rdquo; (9.29-30) The Cicones (failure of his men to find moderation in their savagery and drunkenness) After leaving Troy, Odysseus and her men aim to get more spoils and more goods and material wealth in order to take home Heading to Immarus Plundering artifacts from countries Countries fight against Odysseus Crew ends up off course and in the land of the Lotus-eaters They manage to get away unharmed Questions: What does it mean to remember? What does it mean to forget? What is necessary to keep/lose? Questions of history and its making History has many flows Crew then ends up in the land of the Cyclopes- Takes 12 companions to seek hospitality from the locals who lead them to a cave where Polyphemus live “No man” Tricks the other cyclops \u0026ldquo;From the cave mighty Polyphemus roared: \u0026lsquo;Nobody is killing me, my friends, / by treachery, not using any force\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; (9.403-4). \u0026ldquo;He stretched out his arms, / attempting to catch anyone who tried / to escape there with the sheep\u0026rdquo; (9.415-17).” Polyphemus kills 2 of the men and eats them In order to escape, they must have Polyphemus open the door to the cave so that they can escape Get him drunk- They blind him with a stick and he is therefore unable to find Odysseus Odysseus abuses verbally the Polyphemus (Poseidon\u0026rsquo;s son)- makes Poseidon hate Odysseus The cyclops; \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t grow / any plants by hand or plough the earth, / but put their trust in the immortal gods, / and though they never sow or work the land, / still every kind of crop springs up for them\u0026rdquo; (9.92-96). \u0026ldquo;Each one of them / sets out laws for his own wives and children, / and they shun all dealings with each other\u0026rdquo; (9.101-103). \u0026ldquo;He avoided others / and lived alone, away from all the rest, / a law unto himself, a monster, made to be a thing of wonder, not like a man, / who survives by eating bread, no, more like / a soaring wooded mountain standing there / to view in isolation from the rest\u0026rdquo; (9.145-51 ). \u0026ldquo;l told the rest of my trustworthy crew / to stay there beside the ship and guard it, / while I selected twelve of my best men / and went off to explore. I took with me / a goatskin full of dark sweet wine\u0026rdquo; (9.152-55). \u0026ldquo;l was keen / to see the man in person and find out / if he would show me hospitality (9.180-82). \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re here / as suppliants to you, and Zeus protects / all suppliants and strangers—as god of guests, / he cares for all respected visitors\u0026rdquo; (9.218-21 ). Another example of the theme of hospitality Men are brash to assume that the host will agree to their indulgence Odysseus escaped through hanging onto the bottom of the sheep Another instance of Odysseus being mortal, cannot compete with the might of a god such as Poseidon Odysseus travels to Aeolia Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag of ox hide Unknown why he did this In reality this is the “bag of winds” They can see Ithaca- Odysseus falls asleep The others on the boat open the sack in order to see what is in it (they seemed to believe that it was treasure) The winds and seas push the boat back to Aeolia King is furious- no lenience \u0026ldquo;Of all living mortals, you are the worst— so you must leave this island with all speed. It would violate all sense of what is right if I helped out or guided on his way a man the blessed gods must hate. So leave. You\u0026rsquo;re here because the deathless gods despise you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Once they heard his [Antiphates] call, / the mighty Laestrygonians poured out, / thronging in countless numbers from all sides—/ not like men at all, but Giants\u0026rdquo; (131-34). They encounter man-eating giants called Laestrygonians Trapped the 12 ships- only Odysseus ship escaped They then encounter Circe and her island-turns a party of men into pigs- one escapes to warn the others Hermes gives him the antidote to Circe’s powers- makes Circe vow not to plot or take revenge against his crew. The Pigs are then turned back into men \u0026ldquo;Inside their pens they wept. / Circe threw down some feed in front of them— / acorns, beech nuts, and cornel fruit—the stuff / pigs eat when they are wallowing in mud\u0026rdquo; (10.217-220). \u0026ldquo;Take a remedial medicine with you, / and go to Circe\u0026rsquo;s house. It will protect you\u0026rdquo; (10.239-40). \u0026ldquo;l found my trusty comrades at the ship / lamenting sadly, shedding many tears. / Just as on farms calves frisk around the herd / when cows, having had their fill of grazing, / return back to the yard—they skip ahead, / and pens no longer hold them, as they run, / mooing in a crowd around their mothers, / that\u0026rsquo;s how my companions, once they saw me, / thronged around\u0026rdquo; (378-83) Odysseus and crew go to the shores of the underworld Perform a sacrifice which brings the spirits of the dead to drink the blood Also includes Odysseus aunt Claire Revealed that she died from the grief of his absence The Prophet Tiresias comes with the spirits Tiresias offers a grim future for Odysseus: \u0026ldquo;a god will make your journey bitter\u0026rdquo; (11.66) but he offers some hope and a warning: \u0026ldquo;If you leave [the cattle and rich flocks of Helios the sun god] unharmed and keep your mind / on your return, you may reach Ithaca\u0026rdquo; (71-72). Further, he tells Odysseus: \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;ll be trouble at home—insolent men / eating up your livelihood and wooing / your godlike wife by giving courtship gifts\u0026rdquo; (11 . 79-81 ). \u0026ldquo;Your death will come / out of the sea, such a gentle passing, / when you are bowed down with a ripe old age, / and your people prospering around you\u0026rdquo; (100-3). Another relationship between the mortal and the immortal “Odysseus sees a procession of military heroes and women including Ajax, Agamemnon, and Epicaste (Jocasta), the wife/mother of Oedipus. He sees other mythological figures like Tantalus and Sisyphus. Most significant, he meets Achilles.” \u0026ldquo;Before now, / while you were still alive, we Achaeans / honored you as we did the gods. And now, / since you\u0026rsquo;ve come down here, you rule with power / among those who have died. So Achilles, / you have no cause to grieve because you\u0026rsquo;re dead\u0026rdquo; (11.330-35). Achilles responds: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to comfort me about my death, / glorious Odysseus. I\u0026rsquo;d rather live . working as a wage-laborer for hire / by some other ma, one who had not land / and not much livelihood, than lord it over all the waster dead\u0026rdquo; (11.337-42) Circe warns the returned Odysseus of his next obstacles, the sirens and later, the Scylla and Charybdis. Then will arrive at Helio’s island, Thrinacia, where he’ll find the cattle and sheep not meant to be interfered with. The Sirens: \u0026ldquo;No man has ever rowed his black ship / past here without attending to our songs, / sweet-voiced melodies sung from our own lips. / That brings him joy, and he then goes away / a wiser man, for we two understand / all the misfortunes faced by Trojans and Achaeans\u0026rdquo; (12.154-60). Must also make it past the 6 headed Hydra To prevent the men from hearing the sirens and falling victim to them, beeswax is put into the men\u0026rsquo;s ears Scylla and Charybdis: \u0026ldquo;l did not mention Scylla—for she was / a threat for which there was no remedy—in case my comrades, overcome with fear, / stopped rowing and huddled up together / inside the boat\u0026rdquo; (12.191-95). \u0026ldquo;When we saw Charybdis, we were afraid / we\u0026rsquo;d be destroyed. Then Scylla snatched away / six of my companions, right from the ship / \u0026hellip; / They cried and screamed, calling me by name / on final time, their hearts in agony\u0026rdquo; (12.209-11 , 216-17). Lost six of the men on the boat to the Hydra Men are tired and do not want to continue on, and despite Odysseus not agreeing, land the ship on the island of Thrinacia At Thrinacia, observing Helios\u0026rsquo; cattle and sheep: \u0026ldquo;Shipmates, / let all of you now swear this solemn oath— / if by chance we find a herd of cattle / or a large flock of sheep, not one of you / will be so overcome with foolishness / that you will kill a cow or sheep\u0026rdquo; (12.237-42). \u0026ldquo;Once what we had stored / inside our ship was gone, they had to roam, / scouring around for game and fish and birds, / whatever came to hand\u0026rdquo; (12. 270-73). \u0026ldquo;The gods / immediately sent my men bad omens— / hides crept along the ground, while on the spits / the meat began to bellow, and a sound / like cattle lowing filled the air\u0026rdquo; (12.358-62) Helios takes his revenge, conjures a storm that wipes out all of the crew on the deck of the ship. Odysseus escapes by taking hold of a branch of a tree above the whirlpool swallowing the ship Reprisals: \u0026ldquo;All at once, West Wind whipped up / a frantic storm—the blasts of wind snapped off / both forestays on the mast, which then fell back, / \u0026hellip; / In the stern part of the ship, the falling mast / struck the helmsman on his head, caving in / his skull, every bone at once. Then he fell, / like a diver, off the boat. His proud spirit / left his bones. Then Zeus roared out his thunder / and with a bolt of lightning struck our ship. / The blow from Zeus\u0026rsquo;s lightning made our craft / shiver from stem to stern and filled it up / with sulphur smoke. My men fell overboard / and rode atop the waves\u0026rdquo; (12.375-88). I was guided to Ogygia by the gods, / the island where fair-haired Calypso live\u0026rdquo; (12.420-21). Odysseus is returned to Ithaca by the Phaeacians as he sleeps (Book 13) Does not initially recognize his homeland Athena: \u0026ldquo;Stranger, you must be a fool, or else come / from somewhere far away, if you must ask / about this land. Its name is not unknown— / not at all—many men have heard of it. Ithaca is well known, even in Troy, / a long way from Achaean land, they say\u0026rdquo; (13.80-85). \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what Fate has in store for you. / You\u0026rsquo;ll find harsh troubles in your well-built home. / Be patient, for you must endure them all\u0026rdquo; (104-6). \u0026ldquo;she touched him with her staff. / She wrinkled the lovely skin on his supple limbs / and took the dark hair from his head\u0026rdquo; (13.152-54) Book 14 Meets Eumeaus, the swineherd, a slave that is the most loyal to him Still remains committed to Odysseus \u0026ldquo;It would be wrong, / stranger, for me to disrespect a guest, / even if one worse off than you arrive, / for every guest and beggar comes from Zeus\u0026rdquo; (14.41-44).” Theme of Hospitality repeats again Eumeanus is hospitable to Odysseus (in disguise), and attempts to make him comfortable even with his meager means Book 15: Athena tells Telemachus to hurry home. Warns him about the trap that the suitors have set for him. Has his ship drop him off before the city so that he can approach in secret. Odysseus and Eumaeus spend an evening together Book 16: Telemachus arrives at Eumaeus’s hut and then sees his son for the first time in 20 years. They share Eumaeus’s food. When Eumaeus leaves, Athena transforms Odysseus into his real self. They then lay out their plans to defeat the suitors- 108 suitors and ten servants Eumaeus gives Penelope the message- at the same time as Telemachus sailors arrive Plot against Telemachus’s life, even while denying that they mean him harm when confronted by Penelope \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not one of the gods. / Why do you compare me to immortals? / But I am your father, on whose account / you are grieving and suffer distress / having to bear men\u0026rsquo;s acts of insolence\u0026rdquo; (16. 95-99). Odysseus\u0026rsquo; plan is slaughter, but Telemachus is clear about their odds: \u0026ldquo;Here, you can soon add up / their numbers—from Dulichium there are / fifty two hand-picked young men, six servants / in their retinue, from Same [nearby island] twenty-four, / from Zacynthus twenty young Achaeans, and from Ithaca itself twelve young men, / all nobility\u0026rdquo; (16.134-40). \u0026ldquo;Do you believe Athena, / along with Father Zeus, will be enough / for the two of us, or should I think about / who else might help us?\u0026rdquo; (16.151-54). Book 17: Eumaeus orders Eumaeus to bring the beggar to the palace Telemachus goes ahead and returns home and receives a welcome Encounter Melanthius the goatherd who gives Odysseus a kick and some verbal abuse Suitors have a feast Antinous and Eurymachus are the leaders of the suitors “Bk 17 Eumaeus (unwittingly) will bring Odysseus into the city still in disguise as an old beggar On the way, they are accosted by Melanthius, a servant of the suitors: \u0026ldquo;Now here we have a truly filthy man / leading on another filthy scoundrel. / As always, a god matches like with like\u0026rdquo; (17.99-101 \u0026ldquo;It was Argus, brave Odysseus\u0026rsquo;s hunting dog / \u0026hellip;. / Argus lay there / covered in fleas. But then, when he saw Odysseus / who was coming closer, Argus wages his tail / and dropped his ears / \u0026hellip;. / once Book 18: Good for nothing beggar arrives at the palace Outraged to find another beggar, he is aggressive towards Odysseus Disguised, Odysseus begs from each of the suitors, testing them. Antinous, their leader, is cruel: \u0026ldquo;What god / sent this nuisance to interrupt our feast? / You\u0026rsquo;re an insolent and shameless beggar— / you come up to each of us, one by one, / and we give you things without holding back, / for there\u0026rsquo;s no check or scruple when one gives / from someone else\u0026rsquo;s goods, and each of us / has so much food set here in front of him\u0026rdquo; (17.194-201)he\u0026rsquo;d seen Odysseus after nineteen years, / Argus collapsed, gripped in the fatal clutch of death\u0026rdquo; (17.117, 125-28, 54-55).” Melantho a slave girl who sleeps with Eurymachus mocks Odysseus Book 19: Book 19 Odysseus meets with Penelope: \u0026ldquo;he made his many falsehoods sound just like the truth\u0026rdquo; (19.42).

Minos determined to remove the cause of this opprobrium from his abode, enclosing it within a labyrinth devised and built by Daedalus.

The highest note of a melody Legato → Sung or played in a smooth or connected setup Staccato → May be performed in a short or detached matter Letters commonly used for discussing the segments of the peices lowercase for shorter sections (a,b,etc) Uppercase letters for longer sections (A,B,etc) Melody and Words# Melody expresses the meaning and emotion of the words Melody can evoke feeling in the listeners Chapter 6- Harmony# Harmony refers to the way chords are constructed and how they follow each other Consonance and Dissonance# Consonance → A tone combination that is stable Dissonance → A tone combination that is unstable Tension demands an onward motion to a stable Resolution → Dissonance has its resolution when it moves to a consonance Consonance and dissonance can exist in varying degrees Some or more or less stable than other The Triad# Triad → Most basic chord Harmony- simultaneous tones in music that add support and richness to melody Tonic chord → The main chord of the piece Subdominant chord - the triad based on the fourth note of the scale Dominant chord- built on the fifth note Cadence - means both the resting point at the end of the melodic phrase Broken Chords (Arpeggios)# Broken Chord or Arpeggio - Individual tones of a chord are sounded one after another Chapter 7- Key# Key involves not only a central tone but also a central scale or chord Scale is the basic pitches of a piece of music arranged from low to high The Major Key# The major scale has two kinds of intervals: Half-steps and whole-steps Half-step is the smallest interval traditionally used in western music Whole step is twice as large as the half step The Minor Scale# Consists of seven different tones and an eighth tone that duplicates the first an octave higher Minor scale can begin on any of the twelve tones in an octave Thus, there are 12 minor scales Major and Minor keys# When a piece is based off of a major scale → Major Key When a piece of music is based off of a minor scale → Minor Key To indicate the key of a music - composer uses a key signature The Chromatic Scale# Twelve tones of the octave form the chromatic scale Tones of the chromatic scale same distance apart, unlike major and minor scales Tones are one half-step apart Chromatic scale does not define a key Contribute to a sense of motion and tension Modulation- Change of key# Short pieces of music - single key from beginning to end Longer pieces of music, variety or contrast created by using more than one key Modulation → Shifting from one key to another within the piece Tonic Key# No matter the amount that a piece has been changed, there is usually only one home note Modulation is moving away from the home key, but then eventually returning to the home key Chapter 8- Musical Texture# Musical texture - refers to how many different layers of sound are heard at a time Described as: Dense Thin Thick Heavy Light Monophonic Texture# Monophonic → Having one sound Singing alone Single line with the same pitch in unison makes a stronger sound than singing alone Polyphonic Texture# Polyphonic → Having many sounds Each line of the piece enriches the other Counterpoint → Combining several melodic lines into a whole Round → song in which the same melody is sung or played at slightly different times Homophonic Texture# Homophonic → One main melody accompanied by chords Chords are subordinate to the melody Chapter 9- Musical forms# Form → organization of musical elements in time Techniques that Create Musical Form# Repetition → Creates a sense of unity Contrast → Provides variety Variation → keeps some elements of musical thought while changing others -

However, her father limited Fanny\u0026rsquo;s musical ambitions by saying that as an upper-class young woman she could never aspire to be a professional musician like her brother Felix: \u0026ldquo;Music will perhaps be his profession, whilst for you it can only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing.\u0026rdquo; Even her beloved brother Felix agreed with their father and discouraged Fanny from publishing her compositions. In 1826, two of her songs were published together with four songs by Felix under his name. Years later Felix visited Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace and accompanied her as she sang a song she thought was by him. After the Queen praised the song, Felix admitted to her that it was composed by his sister. When she was twenty-three, Fanny married Wilhelm Hensel, painter at the court in Berlin, who encouraged her musical activities. The couple\u0026rsquo;s only child was named Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel after Fanny\u0026rsquo;s favorite composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Felix Mendelssohn. In 1831, Fanny became music director and performer at Sunday concerts in the Mendelssohn family mansion, reviving the musicales her parents had hosted years before. Fanny\u0026rsquo;s concerts were attended by up to 200 invited guests from Berlin\u0026rsquo;s elite. The works heard included compositions ranging from Bach to Chopin, and guest performers included such famous virtuosos as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. In 1846, persuaded by praise from musicians, Fanny wrote in her diary, \u0026ldquo;I have made up my mind to publish my things.\u0026rdquo; To Felix she wrote: \u0026ldquo;I am as afraid of you my brother at age 40 as I was of Father at age 14\u0026hellip;1 hope I won\u0026rsquo;t disgrace all of you through my publishing.\u0026rdquo; Felix replied giving Fanny his \u0026ldquo;professional blessing on your decision to join our guild.\u0026rdquo; Several of her works finally appeared in print under her name, but less than a year later, in 1847 at age forty-one, Fanny died of a stroke.\nProgram Music# Romantic composers were particularly attracted to program music- music associate with a story, poem, idea or scene Fantastic Symphony Romeo and Juliet Moldau Hector Berlioz# One of the first romantic composers and a daring creator of new orchestral sounds Born in a small town near Grenoble Originally was supposed to study medicine in Paris Studied at the Paris Conservatory, composed and went to the Opera House Liked the works of Shakespeare Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Music# Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky# Antonin Dvorak# Johannes Brahms# Romantic who breathed new life into classical forms Georges Bizet# Giuseppe Verdi# Giacomo Puccini# Richard Wagner# "}]
