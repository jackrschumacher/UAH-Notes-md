# Concept 3.1: Polar covalent bonds in water
- Properties of water arise from actions of oppositely charged atoms of different water molecules
- Positive hydrogen of one molecule attracted to negative oxygen of a nearby molecule

-
- # Concept 3.2
- ## Cohesion of Water Molecules
	- Water molecules stay close to each other as a result of hydrogen oxygen bonding
	- Water is more structured than most other liquids
	- water has high surface tension- cohesion
	- Also contributes to the transport of water

	- Air temperature is also moderated by water
	- Effective as a heat bank
	- Water has kinetic energy (energy of mtion)
	- Thermal energy is associated with the movement of atoms
	- Temperature represents the average kinetic energy of a body of matter reflects the total kinetic energy
		- Depends on the matter volume
	- Heat is thermal energy that transfers between objects
- ### Waters high specific heat
	- Stabilize temperature stems from high specific heat
	- Defined as the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of the substance for its temp to increase by 1C
	- 1/cal per gram
	- This high specific heat is due to hydrogen bonding - this is why ocean temps can be stabilized

- ### Evaporative cooling
	- Molecules stay close to each other
	- Transformation to a liquid to a gas- vaporization
	- At low temps, speediest molecules escape into the air
	- To evaporate 1g at 25 → 580 cal of heat is needed
	- Helps to moderate climate
	- As liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down- evaporative cooling
		- Contributes to stability of temperature in lakes and ponds
		- Animals without sweat glands use water to cool down
		- Evaporation of sweat from human skin helps to cool down
- ### Floating of Ice on Liquid water
	- Ice floats on liquid water
	- Water expands as it solidified
	- Water freezes because more and more of its molecules are moving too slowly to break bonds
	- Water also floats due to its lower density
- ## Water, the solvent of life
	- Glass contain a uniform mixture of sugar and water
	- Concentration of dissolved sugar will be the same everywhere in the mixture
	- Solution - combination of liquids
	- Water is a very versatile solvent
- ### Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic substances
	- Hydrophilic - water loving
	- Hydrophobic - water fearing
- # Concept 3.3
	- Hydrogen atoms in water can sometimes shift from one module to another
		- Transferred as a hydrogen ion
		- Molecule that lost a proton is now a hydroxide ion

- ### Acids and Bases
	- When acids dissolve in water the donate h+ to the solution
	- #### Acidic solution
	- Acid is a substance that increases hydrogen ion concentration
	-
$$ \ce{HCL \rarr H+ + Cl-} $$		- Results in an acidic solution
	- #### Base
		- Concentration indirectly by dissociating to form hydroxide ions

- ### Buffers
	- Internal ph is 7
	- Slight change to ph can be harmful because the chemical processes of the cell are sensitive to concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions

	- Acidification bad for sea organisims
