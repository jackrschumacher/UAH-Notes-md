# Macromolecules as Polymers
	- Each class of polymer is made up of a different type of monomer
		- Chemical mechanisms by which cells make polymers (polymerization)
	- Process facilitated by enzymes
	- Condensation reaction → connects a monomer to another monomer or polymer
	- Dehydration reaction → when a water molecule is lost

	- Polymers are disassembled by hydrolsis
		- Water breakage
	- The bond between monomers is broken by the addition of a water molecule
- ## Diversity of Polymers
	- Cell has thousands of different macromolecules
	- Basis for diversity in lifes polymers
	- Arrangement is key
- # Carbohydrates serve as fuel/building material
	- Include sugars and polymers of sugars
- ## Sugars
	- **Monosaccharides** → have molecular formulas that are some multiple of the unit
	- Molecule has a carbonyl group
	- Monosaccharide is either aldose or ketose

	- Sugars are diverse because of how their parts are arranged spatially around asymmetric carbons
	- **Disaccharide** → consists of two monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkage
	- Maltose is a disaccharide formed by linking of two molecules of glucose

- ## Polysaccarharides
	- Macromolecules with monosaccarides
- ### Storage polysaccharides
	- Plants and animals store sugars for later use in the form of storage polysaccharides
	- Plants store starch - a polymer of glucose monomers

	- Animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen
- ### Structural Polysaccharides
	- Cellulose - key component of walls of plant cells
	- Chitin-  carbohydrate used by anthropods
- # Lipids
- ## Fats
	- Fats are not polymers - they are large molecules assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions
	- Fat consists of glycerol molecule joined to 3 fatty acids
	- Glycerol is an alchol
	- Fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton (16-18) carbon atoms
- ## Phospholipids
	- Cells could not exist without phospholipids
	- Essential for cells because they are constituents of cell membranes

- ## Steroids
	- Carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings
	- Cholesterol - type of steroid that is a crucial molecule in animals

- # Protein functions

- # Nucleic acids
	- DNA and RNA enable living organisms to reproduce their complex components from one generation to the next
	- DNA provides directions
		- Also directs RNA synthesis
		- Controls protein synthesis
		- Gene expression
- # Genomics
