## Elements and Compounds

- Matter is made up of elements
- Recognize 92 elements occurring in nature
	- Gold
	- Copper
	- Carbon
	- Oxygen
- Compound is a substance consisting of two or more different elements combined in a fixed ratio

- ### The elements of life
  - 92 natural elements
  - Elements that an organism needs to live a healthy life and reporduce
  - Humans need 25 elements but plants need only 17
  - Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen make up approx. 95% of living matter
  - Some naturally occurring elements
- ### Elements properties depend on the structure of atoms
  - #### Subatomic particles
  	- Atom is the smallest unit having the properties of an element
  	- Neutron, proton, electrons
  	- Neutron and proton are almost identical in mass
  	- Atomic number tells us how many protons are in an items nucleus

  - #### Isotopes
  	- Different atomic forms of the same element are isotypes
  	- Can also be used as tools in medicine
  	- Radioactive tracers can be used in medicine to track if certain diseases exist
  - #### Radioactive items
  	- Can measure the decay in fossils to date these relics of a past life
  	- Parent isotope decays into its daughter isotype at a fixed rate
  		- Known as the half life
  - #### The energy level of electrons
  	- **Energy** - The capacity to cause change
  	- **Potential energy** - the energy that matter posses because of its location and structure
  	- Electrons of an atom have potential energy due to the distance to the nucleus

  	- Electrons are found in different electron shells - each with a characteristic average distance and energy level
  	- An electron can move from one shell to another
  		- When an electron absorbs energy it moves to a shell farther out from the nucleus
  - #### Electron Distribution and Chemical properties
  	- Chemical behavior of an atom is determined by the distribution of electrons in the atoms electron shells

  - #### Electron orbitals
  	- We can not truly know where the atom is located
  	- Electron shell contains electrons at a particular energy level
  	- Orbital is a component of an electron shell
- ### The formation and function of molecules and iconic compounds
  - Atoms with incomplete valence shells can interact with other atoms in order to complete the valence shell
  - Valence and usually equals the number of electrons required to complete the outermost valence shell
  - Attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called **electronegativity**
  - **Non-polar covalent bond** A type of covalent bond in which electrons are shared equally between atoms of similar electronegativity
  - **Polar covalent bond** - Bonds that vary in their polarity
  - #### Ionic bonds
  	- **Ions** - two resulting oppositely charged atoms
  	- **Cation**- positively charged ion
  	- **Anion** - negatively charged ion
  	- Cations and anions attract each other, resulting in an **ionic bond**
  	- Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called **ionic compounds or salts**
  - #### Weak Chemical Interactions
  	- Most of the strongest chemical bonds are covalent bonds
  	- Large biological molecules are held by weak interactions
  - #### Hydrogen Bonds
  	- This noncovalent attraction between hydrogen and electronegative atoms

  - #### Van der Walls interactions
  	- Electrons not always not always evenly distributed
  	- Van der Walls interactions are individually weak and occur only when atoms and molecules are vey close
  - #### Molecular shape and Function
  	- Shapes determined by the positions of the atoms
  	- Atom forms covalent bonds the orbitals in its valence shell undergo rearrangement
- ### Chemical reactions and chemical bonds

  - **Chemical reactions** - the making and breaking of chemical bonds
  - Use an arrow to indicate the change
  - **Reactants** - Starting materials
  - **Products**- resulting materials
  - **Chemical equilibrium** - Point at which the reactions offset one each other
