## The formation of Bonds with Carbon
- Carbon has 6 electrons with 2 in first electron shell and 4 in second shell
- 4 valence electrons in a shell that can hold up to 8 electrons
- Carbon atom usually completes its valence shell by sharing 4 electrons with other atoms so that 8 electrons are present
- Carbon atoms four covalent bonds
- Arrangement of four hybrid orbitals causes bonds to angle towards corners of tetrahedron

- ## Chemical groups most important in processes of life
- Male and female sex hormones are steriods
- Differ only in chemical groups attached to the rings

- Chemical reactions are functional groups
- Seven chemical groups:
- Carboynl
- Carboxyl
- Amino
- Sulfhydryl
- Phosphate
- Methyl
- First 6 groups are chemically reactive

- ## ATP: Source of Energy for Cellular processes
- Shows a simple example of an organic phosphate molecule
- ATP is worth mentioning because function in the cell is important
