- ## 6.1- An organisms metabolism transforms matter and energy
	- ### Metabolic pathways
		- Roadmap of chemical reactions, arranged as intersecting metabolic pathways
		- **metabolic pathway** a specific molecule is altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a specific product
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1772249184729_0.png)
		- As a whole manages the material and energy resources of the cell
		- Some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds
		- **Catabolic pathways** breakdown pathways
		- **Anabolic pathways** consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones
			- Synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and synthesis of a protein from amino acids
		- Catabolic and anabolic pathways are the downhill and uphill avenues of the metabolic landscape
		- Energy released from downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive uphill reactions of anabolic pathways
		- Also applies to **bioenergetics** - study of how energy flows through living organisms
	- ### Forms of Energy
		- **Energy-** capacity to cause change
		- **Kinetic energy-** Can be associated with the relative motion of objects
			- Thermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random movement of atoms or molecules
		- **Potential energy-** energy that is not kinetic
		- **Chemical energy-**term used biologists to refer to the potential energy available for release in a chemical reaction
			- Catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules
			- Some bonds are broken and others are formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products
			- Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes

	- ### Laws of Energy Transformation
		- **Thermodynamics-** study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called
		- #### First Law of Thermodynamics
			- *Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it can not be created or destroyed*
		- #### Second Law of Thermodynamics
			- *Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe*
			- Some energy is converted to thermal energy and released as heat
			- System can put thermal energy to work only when there is a temperature difference that results in thermal energy flowing as heat from a warmer location to a cooler one
			- Energy transferred makes the universe more disordered
			- **Entropy-** measure of molecular disorder or randomness
			- Can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building over time
		- #### Biological order and disorder
			- Predicted by thermodynamic law
			- Cells create ordered structures from less organized starting materials
			- Increase in order is balanced by and organisms taking in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replacing them with less ordered forms

    		Animals obtain starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal release carbon dioxide and water
  
- ## 6.2- The free energy change of a reaction
	- ### Free energy change
		- Universe is the system + the surroundings
		- **Free energy-** the portion of a systems energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system
		- Δ G = Δ H - T Δ S
		- Δ H symbolizes the change in the systems enthalpy/total energy
		- Δ G - can predict whether the process will be spontaneous
			- To be negative H must be negative
			- TS must be positive
			- When tallied they should have a negative value
		- Allows biologists to predict which kinds of change can happen without an input of energy
	- ### Free Energy, Stability, and Equilibrium
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1772252037851_0.png)
		- Think of free energy as a measure of a systems instability- tendency to change to a more stable state
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1772252210709_0.png)
		- Unstable systems are rich in free energy (G)
		- Tend to change to a
		- **Equilibrium-** the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rates
			- When at equilibrium, G is at its lowest possible value in that system
			- Change from the equilibrium position will have positive G and will not be spontaneous
	- ### Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions in metabolism
		- **Exergonic reaction-** proceeds with a net release of free energy
			- Δ G is negative for an exergonic reaction

		- #### Cellular Respiration example

			-
    	For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration under what are called "standard conditions" (1 M of each reactant and product, 250C, pH 7), 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of energy is made available for work. Because energy must be conserved, the chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy per mole than the reactants. The products are, in a sense, the spent exhaust of a process that tapped the free energy stored in the bonds of the sugar molecules.
    
		- **Endergonic reaction-** one that absorbs free energy from its surroundings
			- Reactions are non spontaneous, and the magnitude of Δ G is the quality of energy required to drive the reaction
			- If a chemical process is exergonic (downhill), releasing energy in one direction, then the reverse process must be endergonic using energy
	- ### Equilibrium and Metabolism
		- Reactions in an isolated system eventually reach equilibrium and can then do no work
		- Chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible and they too would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1772253209812_0.png)
		- A living cell is not in equilibrium
		- Materials flow in and out, keeping metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium
		- Some actions are constantly pulled in one direction- that is they are kept out of equilibirum
