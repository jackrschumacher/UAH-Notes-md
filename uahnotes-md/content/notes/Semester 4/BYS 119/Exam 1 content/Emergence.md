## Notes

- Universe tells us that everything breaks down
- How do groups of animals move as one
  - Invisible force? 
  - **Emergence**
- These types of things are mostly a mystery
- Order does not seem to be coming from the top down
  - Some rules for the organisms to follow
    - Maintain distance between organisms
    - Avoid organisms
    - Almost like the crowd rules with people
      - Or a crosswalk
      - Also like a computer playing chess
        - Organisms follow a simple set of rules 
    - Sum of the parts
- Increasingly complex levels of organization in organisms and life
  - Scientists would like to quantify emergent complexity
  - May be possible in the future
