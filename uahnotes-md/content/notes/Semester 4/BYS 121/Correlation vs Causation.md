---

- **Science** - Systematic study of structure and behavior in the natural world.
- **Rational reasoning** - Uses logic, evidence, and careful evaluation in order to form conclusions about an observation
- **Scientific thinking** - Type of rational reasoning that involves applying the scientific method to problem solving - forming hypotheses and collecting and analyzing data
- **The scientific method** - the process through which scientists test questions based on the observations that they have made
  - Begins with a research question
  - **Hypothesis** - refers to a testable explanation for why something occurs
  - **Procedure** - tests the hypothesis
  - Determines if the data supports the results
- **Correlation** - that two variables are associated or change together
  - **Positive Correlation** - When one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase
  - **Negative Correlation** - When one variable increases, other tends to decrease
  - **No correlation** - No relationship between variables
  - Independent = cause
  - Dependent variable = effect
