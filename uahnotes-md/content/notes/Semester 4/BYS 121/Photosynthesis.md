	- One of the most important biological processes on earth
	- Allows light energy from the sun to be converted into chemical energy stored in organic molecules
	- All life depends on this process, either directly or indirectly
	- Sugars produced during photosynthesis- become the fuel for cellular respiration- powers all living organisims
	- $6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{light energy} \rarr C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$
- # Chloroplasts
	- Photosynthesis occurs inside of an organelle called a chloroplast
	- Typically found in mesophyll cells
	- Carbon dioxide enters the leaf through small openings called stomata and diffuses into these cells, where photosynthesis occurs
	- Thylakoids are arranged in stacks and are surrounded by fluid-filled region known as the stoma
	- Contain chlorophyll and other pigments, along with protein complexes that capture light energy and begin converting it into chemical energy

	- Separation between the thylakoid space and the stroma allows the chloroplast to build chemical gradients that are necessary for ATP production
	- Physical arrangement of membranes is not random it is required to build carbohydrates
	- ## Light absorption and pigments
		- Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation
		- Different wavelengths carry different amounts of energy
			- Blue light has shorter wavelengths than high energy
			- Red light has longer wavelengths and lower energy
		- Primary pigment involved in photosynthesis is chlorophyll
		- Chlorophyll absorbs mainly blue and red light and reflects green light
		- Increase the efficiency of light capture specifically in shaded or low light enviroments
		- When Chlorophyll absorbs a photon, one of its electrons becomes excited
			- Carries energy and this energy is transferred through a series of reactions that ultimately allow the plant to convert light energy into chemical energy
	- ## Photosynthesis and Earth's history
		- Very significant in evolutionary history
		- Did not produce oxygen and used molecules other than water as electron donors
		- Early organisms were some of the first to harness solar energy
		- Occurred when organisms occurred when certain organisms evolved the ability to use water as an electron donor
		- Rise of oxygen dramatically changed earths enviroment
		- With more energy available, organisms could become larger, more complex, and multicelluar
			- Complex animals, plants and humans would not exist without this
		- Chloroplasts are evidence of evolution in action
		- Originated from an ancient endosymbiotic event in which a eukaryotic cell engulfed in a photosynthetic cyanobacterium
		- Instead of being digested, the bacterium formed a permanent partnership with the host cell and eventually evolved into the chloroplast
		- That's why chloroplasts have their own DNA and resemble bacteria in several ways
	- ## Why photosynthesis still matters
		- Photosynthesis continues to regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen level today
		- Forms the base of nearly all food webs and drives global carbon cycling
		- Fossil fuels represent ancient photosynthetic products products stored over geological time
