# Making Decisions

- ## Fundamentals of Decisions
	- **Decisions** are a commitment to a course of action that serves the interest of certain individuals
	- Managers make decisions affecting the organization daily and communicate those decisions to other organization members
	- Not all managerial decisions are of equal significance to the organization
	- Decisions can affect the members of the org, can also cost a lot of money
	- Can have significant impact on the career of the manager as they move to other organizations
	- Some decisions can also be short term
- ## Types of Decisions
	- Decisions can be classified depending how much time a manager must spend making them
	- **Programmed decision**: Routine and repetitive, developed by the organization
		- Might involve determining how products will be arranged on the shelves of a supermarket
	- **Nonprogrammed decision:** a one-shot decision that is usually less structured than programmed decisions
		- Ex: deciding to expand operations

		- Should be throughout of as being at opposite ends of the decision programming continuum
		- Some decisions can also be neither, but rather fall somewhere in between

- ## Responsibility for Making organization decisions
	- **Scope of the decision:** proportion of the total management system that the decision will affect
	- Greater the proportion, broader the scope of the decision is said to be
	- Lower, Middle, Upper level
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1771635711540_0.png)
	- Important to show which managers are responsible for making the decision
	- Employees closest to a situation are often in the best position to evaluate alternatives or weight in on the issues that will affect the decision
	- **Consensus** an agreement on a decision by all individuals involved in making that decision
	- Manager asks a group to produce a consensus decision must bear in mind that groups might not be able to arrive at a decision
	- Can have both advantages and disadvantages
- ## Elements of Decision situation
	- ### The Decision makers
		- Decision makers usually have one of four orientations: receptive, exploitative, hoarding or marketing
		- *Receptive:* Believe the source of all good is outside themselves, rely on others. Want others to make decisions for them
		- *Exploitative:* Steal from others. Hog credit
		- *Hoarding:* characterized by the desire to preserve the status quo as much as possible
		- *Marketing-oriented:* decision makers view themselves as commodities that are only as valuable as the decisions they make
	- ### Goals to Be Served
		- Seek to attain goals
	- ### Relevant alternatives
		- Decision situation composed of at least two relative alternatives
	- ### Ordering of Alternatives
		- Requires a process or mechanism for ranking alternatives from most desirable to least desirable
		- Can be subjective, objective or a combo
		- Past experience is helpful
	- ### Choice of Alternatives
		- Last element of decision situation is the actual choice among available alternatives
		- Establishes the decision
- ## Rational decision-making process
	- **Rational decision-making process** comprises the steps the decision makes to arrive at a choice
	- Process a manager uses to make decisions has a significant impact on quality of those decisions
	- Decision making steps:
	-
  Identify an existing problem.
  
  List possible alternatives for solving the problem.
  
  Select the most beneficial of these alternatives.
  
  Implement the selected alternative.
  
  Gather feedback to find out whether the implemented alternative is solving the identified problem.

	- ### Identifying an existing problem
		- Essentially a problem-solving process that involves eliminating barriers to organizational goal attainment
		- How problems can be identified:
			- Orders issued by managers supervisors
			- Situation relayed to managers by their subordinates
			- Normal activity of the managers themselves
	- ### Listing alternative solutions
		- Five limitations on the number of problem solving alternatives:
			- Authority factors
			- Biological or human factors
			- Physical factors
			- Technological factors
			- Economic factors
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1771637214438_0.png){:height 372, :width 561}
		- **Paradox of choice** having too many alternatives, which may actualy demotivate decision makers
		- **Inclusion** choose a smaller set of most desirable alternatives from a larger set of alternatives
		- **Exclusion** occurs when individuals exclude the least desirable alternatives from a larger set of alternatives
	- ### Selecting the Most Beneficial alternative
		- Decision makers can select the most beneficial solution only after they have evaluated each alternative carefully
		- Collect info and list effects of decisions
		- Assign a probability to possible effects
		- Compare alternatives with org goals
	- ### Implementing the chosen alternative
		- Put plan into action
		- Support by appropriate action
	- ### Gathering problem-related feeback
		- Decision makers must gather feedback to determine effect of the implemented alternative on the identified problem
		- Identified problem is not bein solved, managers need to seek out and implement another alternative
	- ### Bounded rationality
		- Managers bounded in terms of time, computational power, and knowledge when making decisions
		- Satisfice- individual makes a decision that is not optimal but is good enough
- ## Decision making and Intuition
	- Intuition refers to an individuals inborn ability to synthesize information quickly and effectively
	- ### Decision making heuristics and biases
		- Heuristics- simple rules of thumb
		- Bias- refers to departures from rational theory that produce suboptimal decisions

	- ### Risk and uncertainity
		- **Risk** refers to situations in which statistical probabilities that can be attributed to alternative potential outcomes
		- **Uncertainty** situations where the probability that a particular outcome will occur is not known in advance
		- Vague or unknown probabilities of success are more likely to discourage managers from undertaking actions than is risk
- ## Decision-making tools
	- ### Probability Theory
		- **Probability Theory:** A decision-making tool used in risk situations- in which decision makers are not completely sure the outcome of an implemented alternative
		- **Expected Value (EV):** alternative is the income that the alternative would produce, multiplied by its probability of producing that income
		- `EV = I x P`

	- ### Decision Trees
		- Decisions, however, are more complicated and involve a series of steps
		- **Decision tree:** is a graphic-making tool typically used to evaluate decisions involving a series of steps

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1771638720851_0.png)
		- Analysis of the expected values and net expected gain for each decision alternative helps management decide on an appropriate choice
		- **Net expected gain:** defined in this situation as the expected value of an alternative minus the investment cost
- ## Group decision making
	- Decision makers defined as individuals or groups that actually make a decision
	- Section focuses on groups as decision makers
	- Two key topics discussed here are the advantages and disadvantages of using groups to make decisions
	- ### Advantages and Disadvantages of using groups to make decisions
		- Groups commonly make decisions in organizations
		- Groups are often asked to decide on new products that should be offered
		- Groups can think of more and better alternatives than an individual can
			- Group can draw on collective, diverse organizational experiences
		- Rather than individual managers make organizational decisions may also involve some disadvantages
		- Group decisions cost the org more than individual
	- ### Processes for Making Group decisions
		- Making a sound group decision regarding complex organizational circumstances
		- #### Brainstorming
			- **Brainstorming:** group decision-making process in which negative feedback on any suggested alternative by any group member is forbidden until all members have presented alternatives that they perceive as a valuable
			- Designed to encourage all group members to contribute as many viable decisions as they can think of
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1771639418377_0.png)
		- #### Nominal Group Technique
			- Helps groups make decisions
			- Each group member writes down his or her ideas
			- Each member presents ideas orally
			- Group discusses these ideas simultaneously
			- Discussion is completed, secret ballot is taken to allow members to support their favorite ideas without apprehension
		- #### Delphi Technique
			- A third useful process for helping groups make decisions
			- Circulating questionaries on specific problems to group members, share results with them, refine individual responses until a consensus regarding the problem is reached
			- Problem identified
			- Group members asked to offer solutions to the problem by providing anonomous responses
			- Responses of all group members compiled and sent to all group members
			- Individual group members are each asked to generate a new solution to the problem after they have studied individual responses
			- Steps 3 and 4 repeated until a consensus solution is reached
