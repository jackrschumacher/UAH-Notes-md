* We've finished our review of accounting for merchandising companies and our introduction to accounting for manufacturing companies! We've also introduced you to additional ways to manage manufacturing overhead and other business process improvement methodologies.
  
  The following bullet point list highlights the most important topics for the final.  The best way to review for the exam includes going back through the Lecture Notes for terminology, multiple choice, and journal entry information. Also, carefully review the Chapter Assignment and MyLab Homework information for journal entries in merchandising and manufacturing companies. More emphasis will be given to the merchandising and manufacturing accounting than to Chapter 4, but you want to know the basic calculations for overhead and the terminology for Just-in-Time and Quality Costs! 
  
   
  
  **FINAL EXAM TOPIC LIST:**
  
  **ACCOUNTING FOR MERCHANDISING & MANUFACTURING**
- You will get various questions about aspects of journal entries (as well as direct journal entries), so you need to know what types of amounts would be included in various inventory accounts (Raw Materials, Manufacturing Overhead, Work in Process, and Finished Goods).
- You simply MUST know how to prepare these journal entries! The merchandising journal entry problem will include more types of transactions (some basic expenses, discounts, etc.) and the manufacturing transactions will primarily focus on the movement of value throughout the inventory accounts out of cost of goods sold.
  
  
  
  **CHAPTER 4**
- You need to know the basic calculation for overhead with a single, multiple, and activity predetermined overhead rates.
- You will also get definitional questions on activity based costing, activity based management, just-in-time management, and total quality management with quality costs.
  
  
  
  **MULTIPLE CHOICE & TERMINOLOGY **
- A number of concepts and characteristics in merchandising and manufacturing companies were covered in the material.  There will be Multiple Choice questions that consider you general knowledge regarding other material in the covered chapters, so you need to review the lectures and lecture notes carefully.
- Terminology will, again, be an important part of the exam. Review the lectures and lecture notes, make sure you're comfortable with the different terms across the chapters.
