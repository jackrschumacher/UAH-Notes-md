And then Lleu flew up in the form of an eagle and gave a horrible scream, and he was not seen again" (61).
> "'Every day when the pen is opened she goes out. No one can grab her, and no one knows
> where she goes, any more than if she sank into the earth"' (62).
> "He looks up to the top of the tree. And when he looks, he can see an eagle at the top of the tree. And when the eagle shakes himself, the worms and the rotten flesh fall from him and the sow eats them" (62).
        - Why does he not suspect anything
        - Sort of evocative of what we see in some other texts (George RR Martins Song of Fire and Ice)
          - Also somewhat mimics Game of Thrones
        - Lovers think that they are off the hook
        - Might figure that something is up when Gronw begins taking the lands for himself
          - A conquest of sorts
          - Killed the leader and has taken his place
            - Has also taken his life
        - No one can grab her and no one knows where she goes anymore than if she sank into the earth
> "And they were so afraid that they could only travel with their faces looking backwards. And they knew nothing until they fell into the lake and were drowned, all except Boleuedd" (63).
> '"l will not kill you. I will do worse. Namely, I will release you in the form of a bird .... And all the birds will be hostile towards you"' (63).
> "Blodeuedd is 'owl' in today's language" (63).
        - They do not watch where they are going and fall into a lake where they all drown except for Blodeudd
        - She is finally caught and will be released into the form of a bird (an owl specifically)
> '"No, by my confession to God,' he said. 'And this is the least I will accept from him; he must come to where I was when he threw the spear at me, while I stand where he was. And he must let me throw a spear at him"' (63-64).
> "Gronw took the stone and put it between him and the blow. Then Lleu threw the spear at him, and it pierced through the stone and throughhim too, so that his back was broken and Gronw was killed. And the stone is still there on the bank of the river Cynfael in Ardudwy, with the hole through it" (64).
        - It is through the deceit of the woman that he did what he did
        - Not easy to escape fate \rarr Grow was a killed by a spear that pierced to the throne
        - The stone exists in real life in England
