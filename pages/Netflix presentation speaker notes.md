  Why Personalization  
    
  Matters  
    
  80%+ of viewing comes  
  from personalized  
  recommendations  
    
  Each member sees a  
  unique homepage  
  Reduces choice  
  overload and increases  
  satisfaction  
    
  Personalization  
  improves engagement  
  and reduces churn  
    
  Core driver of Netflix’s  
  competitive position  
    
    
  Artwork & Experience Personalization  
    
  • Personalized thumbnails for each user  
    
  • Contextual bandit algorithms choose  
    
  best artwork  
    
  • Different artwork versions influence click  
    
  behavior  
    
  • Evidence selection: which image, title  
    
  card, or description you see  
    
  • Enhances discovery and increases view -  
    
  starts  
    
    
  Data Collection &  
    
  Insights  
    
  • Behavioral data: watch history,

  location  
    
  • Search & browsing interactions  
    
  • Metadata: genres, cast, tags, release

  ranking  
    
  • Specialized row - level ranking models  
    
  • Page - generation algorithms build each homepage  
    
  layout  
    
  • Constant A/B testing validates impact on  
    
  engagement & retention  
    
  • Interleaving tests compare algorithm versions  
    
  quickly
