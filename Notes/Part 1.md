- # Chapter 1
- Sound beings with the vibration of an object
	- Sound transmitted by a medium
- Music is part of the world of sound
- ## Pitch: Highness or Lowness of Sound
- Pitch → Highness or lowness of a sound
- Sound that has a definite pitch is called a tone
	- Has a specific frequency
	- Vibrations of a tone are regular and reach the ear at regular intervals
	- Tones will sound different with different pitches
- Interval of an octave - interval between first and last tones of the scale
	- Octave has seven different pitched before arriving at the high note which duplicates the first one
	- 7 tones on the keyboard
	- Added 12 tones are duplicated in higher and lower octaves
		- Distance is known as the pitch range
- Most music is based on definite pitches
- ## Dynamics
- Dynamics → Degrees of loudness or softness are known as
	- Loudness or softness affects the type of the sound
- Italian terms indicate dynamics
- Ways to indicate dynamical changes
- Not super precise
	- Tone has a dynamic level - in relation to other tones around the instrument or vocal
- ## Tone Color
- Tone color or Timbre descriptions
	- Bright
	- Dark
	- Brilliant
	- Mellow
	- Rich
- Even though instruments might sound the same, the sound that the instrument creates will likely vary
-
- # Chapter 2
- ## Voices
- Singing demands a greater control of pitch and volume
- Range of singers voice depends on training and physical makeup
- Professionals usually have a vocal range of about 2 octaves
- ## Musical Instruments
- Any mechanism other than a voice that produce musical sounds
- Most instruments have a wider range than voices
- 6 categories of music
	- Woodwind
	- Brass
	- String
	- Percussion
	- Keyboard
	- Electronic
- Instruments have different sizes for different sound ranges
- Instruments are popular based off of the barrier to entry to the general public
- Compositions can be written for more than one person and to large orchestras

- ## String Instruments
- Instruments
	- Violin
	- Viola
	- Cello
	- Double Bass
	- All instruments are similar in setup and are made in the same manner
	-
- Strings have greatest versatility and expressive range
- Pizzicato → Plucked string
- Double Stop → Drawing the bow across two strings
	- Can also be with 3 or 4 strings
- Vibrato → Throbbing expressive tone while vibrating the string using the fingerboard
- Mute → Veil or muffle the tone
- Tremolo → Very high-pitched tones
- ## Woodwind Instruments
- Produce vibrations of air within a tube
	- Traditionally made of wood
	- All have holes along the length of the instrument that are opened or closed by a key mechanism - similar to how the sound of the recorder changes when you cover the holes
- Woodwinds are very different from each other in terms of tone color
- Reed- piece of cane
- Flute- blow over the edge of a mouth hole
- ## Brass Instruments
- Main instruments
	- Trumpet
	- French Horn
	- Trombone
	- Tuba
- Mouthpiece - cup shaped funnel that you blow into to play
- Tube is flared to form a bell at the end of the instruments
- Mute alters the tone color - can be inserted into the bell
- Very powerful- used for climaxes in pieces or for powerful. Also given solo passages
- ## Percussion
- Struck with hand, sticks or hammers or shaken or rubbed
- Vibrations of percussion instruments are caused by stretched membranes for certain instruments or by plates, bars ,etc.
- Percussion instruments have been used to emphasize rhythm, build suspense, etc.
- Oft used by Jazz Musicians
- ## Keyboard instruments
- Instruments
	- Piano
		- Invented around 1700- perfected by the 1850’s
		- Sound produced by strings and hammers
		- The more that you hit the string, the louder it will be
		- Pedals to sustain the tone, veil tone, sustains some tones, not others
		- Harpsichord
			- 1775- replaced by pianos
	- Harpsichord
	- Organ
	- Accordion
	- Pipe Organ
		- Often used for religious ceremonies
	- Accordian
		- Most used in folk setting
- ## Electronic Instruments
- Produce or amplify sound via electronic means
	- Invented around 1904
	- Significant impact on music since 1950
- Types
	- Electric piano
	- Electric Organ
	- Electric Guitars
	- Synthesizers
		- Generate, modify, and control sound
		- Can be played via a keyboard
		- 1960’s-70’s smaller, less expensive keyboards developed
		- Allow for the manipulation of  sounds
		- MIDI, synthesizers work like a Piano
- Tape Studio
	- Main tool in the 1950’s
	- Les Paul,etc
	- Including recorded sounds
	- Manipulated sounds
- Sampling enables composers to hear what their music sounds like using digital technology
- Digital Audio Workstations → DAWs
- # Chapter 3
- ## Rhythm
- Recurring pattern of tension and release
	- Refers to the ordered durations of sounds and silence
- ## Beat
- Regular, recurrent pulsation
- Units of time in which all tones are measured
- Combination of different durations of tones creates the rhythm
- ## Meter
- All of this is part of meter
- Some beats feel stronger or more stressed than others
- Meter → The organization of beats into regular groups
- Measure or Bar → A group containing a fixed number of number of beats
- Downbeat → The first or stressed beat of the measure
- Quadruple meter → 4 beats to the measure, the downbeat is the strongest
	- Jazz and Rock are usually quadruple meter
- Sextuple Meter→ 6 rather quick beats to the measure
- ## Accent and Syncopation
- Individual notes are stressed - how they get special emphasis
	- Accent - note is emphasized by being played louder than the notes around it
	- Syncopation → Accented note comes where there one is not expected
		- When an offbeat note is accented
- ## Tempo
- Tempo is the speed of the beat
	- Fast → associated of energy, drive and excitement
	- Slow → Solemn, lyrical and calm mood
- Tempo indication is usually given at beginning of a piece in Italian
- Accelerando - quickening of the tempo
- Ritardando - becoming slower
- # Chapter 4- Notating Pitch
- Horizontal lines on a staff are called ledger lines
- Seven pitches/tones are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
	- Repeated over to represent the same tones in higher and lower octaves
	- Other 5 tones of the octave correspond to the black keys of the piano
		- Indicated by sharp sign or a flat sign
		- Natural sign cancel a previous sharp or flat sign
	- Clef is placed at the beginning of the staff
		- Treble clef- used for high ranges
		- Bass clef- used for low ranges
- ## Notating Rhythm
- Nation does not indicate the exact duration of tones, it shows how long oen tone lasts in relation to others in the same piece
	- Depends on how the note is written- with stems or flags
- To lengthen a notes, we can make it a dotted note - increases the duration of the note by a half
- Tue also lengthens the duration of the note- connected by a tie
- Rhythmic variety - triplet, etc.
- ## Notating silence
- ## Notating Meter
- Time signature/ meter signature shows the meter of a peice
- Appears at the beginning of the staff at the start of a piece
  
$$
  \frac{2}{4} \text{-2 beats to the measure and a quarter note gets 1 beat. The most common meter is} \frac{3}{4}. \text{Quadruple meter is} \frac{4}{4}
  $$- # Chapter 5
- ## Melody
- Melody → Series of single tones that add up to add up to a recognizable whole
	- Has direction, shape and continuity
	- Conveys tension and release, expectation and arrival
	- Melodic curve or line
- Climax - The highest note of a melody
- Legato → Sung or played in a smooth or connected setup
- Staccato → May be performed in a short or detached matter
- Letters commonly used for discussing the segments of the peices
	- lowercase for shorter sections (a,b,etc)
	- Uppercase letters for longer sections (A,B,etc)
- ## Melody and Words
- Melody expresses the meaning and emotion of the words
- Melody can evoke feeling in the listeners
- # Chapter 6- Harmony
- Harmony refers to the way chords are constructed and how they follow each other
- ## Consonance and Dissonance
- Consonance → A tone combination that is stable
- Dissonance → A tone combination that is unstable
	- Tension demands an onward motion to a stable
- Resolution → Dissonance has its resolution when it moves to a consonance
- Consonance and dissonance can exist in varying degrees
	- Some or more or less stable than other
- ## The Triad
- Triad → Most basic chord
- Harmony- simultaneous tones in music that add support and richness to melody
- Tonic chord → The main chord of the piece
- Subdominant chord - the triad based on the fourth note of the scale
- Dominant chord- built on the fifth note
- Cadence - means both the resting point at the end of the melodic phrase
- ## Broken Chords (Arpeggios)
- Broken Chord or Arpeggio - Individual tones of a chord are sounded one after another
- # Chapter 7- Key
- Key involves not only a central tone but also a central scale or chord
- Scale is the basic pitches of a piece of music arranged from low to high
- ## The Major Key
- The major scale has two kinds of intervals:
	- Half-steps and whole-steps
		- Half-step is the smallest interval traditionally used in western music
		- Whole step is twice as large as the half step
- ## The Minor Scale
- Consists of seven different tones and an eighth tone that duplicates the first an octave higher
- Minor scale can begin on any of the twelve tones in an octave
	- Thus, there are 12 minor scales
- ## Major and Minor keys
- When a piece is based off of a major scale → Major Key
- When a piece of music is based off of a minor scale → Minor Key
- To indicate the key of a music - composer uses a key signature
- ## The Chromatic Scale
- Twelve tones of the octave form the chromatic scale
	- Tones of the chromatic scale same distance apart, unlike major and minor scales
		- Tones are one half-step apart
- Chromatic scale does not define a key
	- Contribute to a sense of motion and tension
- ## Modulation- Change of key
- Short pieces of music - single key from beginning to end
- Longer pieces of music, variety or contrast created by using more than one key
- Modulation → Shifting from one key to another within the piece
- ## Tonic Key
- No matter the amount that a piece has been changed, there is usually only one home note
- Modulation is moving away from the home key, but then eventually returning to the home key
- # Chapter 8- Musical Texture
- Musical texture - refers to how many different layers of sound are heard at a time
	- Described as:
		- Dense
		- Thin
		- Thick
		- Heavy
		- Light
- ## Monophonic Texture
- Monophonic → Having one sound
	- Singing alone
	- Single line with the same pitch in **unison** makes a stronger sound than singing alone
- ## Polyphonic Texture
- Polyphonic → Having many sounds
	- Each line of the piece enriches the other
- Counterpoint →  Combining several melodic lines into a whole
- Round → song in which the same melody is sung or played at slightly different times
- ## Homophonic Texture
- Homophonic → One main melody accompanied by chords
- Chords are subordinate to the melody
- # Chapter 9- Musical forms
- Form → organization of musical elements in time
- ## Techniques that Create Musical Form
- Repetition → Creates a sense of unity
- Contrast → Provides variety
- Variation → keeps some elements of musical thought while changing others - gives a work unity and variety at the same time
- ### Repetition
- Appeals to the pleasure we get in recognizing and remembering something
- Passage of time influences our reaction to repetition
- ### Contrast
- Forward motion, conflict and change of mood
- ### Variation
- Some ideas will be retained while others are changed
- Melody might be restated with a different accompaniment
- ## Types of Musical form
- ### ABA Form
- Contrast between A and B and then return to
- ### AB (Binary form)
- Composition made up of two section is in two part form
- AABB
- # Chapter 10-  Musical Style
- Style - refers to a characteristic was of using melody, rhythm, tone color
	- The was these elements are combined can result in a total sound that’s unique
- Musical styles can change from one era to the next
	- History of western art can be divided into the periods:
		- Middle Ages (450-1450)
		- Renaissance (1450-1600)
		- Baroque (1600-1750)
		- Classical (1750-1820)
		- Romantic (1820-1900)
		- Twentieth century to 1945
		- 1945 to the present
