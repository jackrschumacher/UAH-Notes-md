# Assigning and Allocating Costs
- Product costs consist of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead
- Easily traced and assigned to the product
	- Direct material costs
	- Direct labor costs
- Allocated to the product
	- Manufacturing overhead costs

## Single Plant wide rate
	- A single plant wide rate is called the predetermined overhead allocation rate and is calculated before the period begins

## Multiple Department Rates
	- What if there are two departments with different allocation bases
- Overhead allocation base for Assembly Department is machine hours
- Overhead allocation base for the Software Department is direct labor costs

# How is an activity-based costing system developed?
	- Activity based-management (ABM)
- Focuses on the primary activities the business performs
- Uses cost information to make decisions that lead to greater profits
	- Activity-based costing (ABC) is the process of determining the cost of the activities as building blocks for allocating indirect costs to products and services
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1762802291165_0.png)
	- Developing an activity-based costing system involves 4 steps
#### 1. Identify activities and estimate their total indirect costs
	- Examples of activities include:
		- Quality inspections
			- Inspect raw materials or finished products
		- Shipping
		- Setups
		- Purchasing

		-
#### 2. Identify allocation base for each activity and estimate total quantity of each allocation base
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1762802646920_0.png)
#### 3. Compute the predetermined overhead allocation rate for each activity
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1762802658975_0.png)
#### 4. Allocate indirect costs to the cost object

# Using activity-based management to make decisions?
	- Activity-based management uses activity based costs to make decisions that increase profits while meeting customer needs
- ABM decisions include
	- Pricing and product mix
	- Cost management
## Pricing and Product Mix Decisions
	- Pricing decision
- If the cost per unit changes, should the selling price also change?
	- Product mix decision
- Compare the gross profit of two products and sell the product with the greatest gross profit to maximize total gross profit, considering limited production capabilities
	- To determine which products are the most profitable, company controller recomputes total manufacturing costs and gross profit for standard and premium models

### Cost management decisions
	- Companies adopt ABC to get more accurate product costs for pricing and product mix decisions
	- **Value engineering** reevaluates activities to reduce costs while satisfying customer needs
- Cross-functional teams including marketers, engineers, production personnel, and accountants, work together
	- **Target Pricing**
- Target price is the amount customers are willing to pay for a product or service
- The target cost is the maximum cost to develop, produce and deliver the product or service and earn the desired profit
	- **Cost-based pricing**
- The **full product cost** is the cost to develop, produce and deliver the product or service
- *Desired profit is added* to this full product cost to determine sales price

# Just in time management systems?
	- Reduces inventory costs
- Raw materials and finished goods are completed *just in time* for delivery to customers
- Cost of buying, storing and moving inventory can be significant to companies

# Using a quality management system?
	- System that helps managers improve the business's performance by providing quality products and services is called a quality management system
	- Goals of the system are:
- Improve performance
- Increase customer satisfaction
- Increase profit
	- Four types of Quality costs
- Prevention costs- Costs incurred to avoid poor quality goods or services
- Appraisal costs- Costs incurred to detect poor-quality materials, goods, or services
- Internal failure costs- Costs incurred to correct goods or services before delivery to customers
- External failure costs- Costs incurred after delivery to the customer has occured

# How activity-based management be used in service companies?
	- Same steps as used for manufacturing companies
	- Identify activities and estimate their total indirect costs
	- Identify the allocation base for each activity and estimate the total quantity of each allocation base
	- Compute the predetermined overhead allocation rate for each activity
	- Allocate indirect costs to the cost object

### Just in time costing
	- Tracks costs after the units are completed
	- It combines Raw Materials Inventory and Work in Process Inventory- Raw and In process inventory
	- The conversion costs account combines direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs
