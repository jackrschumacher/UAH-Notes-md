- # Pattern Matching
	- ## Pattern Matching essentials
		- Pattern matching serves two roles in the shell
			- Selecting filenames within a directory
			- Determining whether a string conforms to a desired format
			- **A pattern is a string with a special format designed to match filenames, or to check, classify or validate data strings**
	- ## Pattern Matching with Wildcards
		- Also referred  to as glob patters used to match patters
			- Glob patterns are referred to in the Bash man page as "Pattern Matching"
		- In addition to the simple wildcard characters that are fairly well known, bash also has extended globing which adds features
		- Extended features are enabled via the extglob option

	- ## Pattern Matching with Grep
		- The grep command is a useful tool for filtering text based on patterns
		- **Allows you to search for lines that match a specific pattern and display those lines**
		- Grep commands provides various options and flags that allow you to customize the search and filtering process
		- Supports regex and can be used in combination with other commands to perform complex text filtering

		-
		  ```bash
		  # Filtering lines containing the word apple in the file fruits.txt
		  # This command will display all the lines that match the pattern
		  grep "apple" fruit.txt
		  ```
		-
		  ```bash
		  grep <options> <search pattern> <files>
		  ```

	- ## Pattern Matching with sed
		- The sed command is another useful tool for string manipulation in bash scripting
		- **Allows you to perform various operations on strings, such as substitution, deletion, and insertion**
			- Provides a bunch of options and flags that allows you to customize the string manipulation process
			- Can be combined with other commands to perform string manipulation operations

		-
		  ```bash
		  # Replacing "apple" with "orange" in a string
		  string="I like apple pie."
		  new_strings=$(echo $string | sed 's/apple/orange/') # s/apple/orange is used to specifiy the pattern to match and the replacement string
		  echo "New String: $new_string"
		  # This would output "I like orange pie."
		  ```

- # Vulnerability Scanning
	- ## Linux Logging Basics
		- Provide a bunch of diagnostic information about the computer
		- Everything from kernel events to user actions is logged by Linux-allowing you to see almost any action performed on your servers
	- ## Linux System Logs
		- Logs are stored in /var/log
		- Directory contains logs from the OS,services, and various applications running on the system
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1763241352963_0.png){:height 360, :width 504}
		- **/var/log/syslog** and **/var/log/messages** *store all global activity data*, including startup messages
		- **/var/log/auth.log** and **/var/log/secure** *store all security-related events*
			- Logins, root user actions, output from plugable authentication modules (PAM)
		- **/var/log/kern.log** *stores kernel events, errors, and warning logs*
			- Helpful for troubleshooting custom kernels
		- **var/log/cron** stores *information aobut scheduled tasks (cron jobs)*
			- Use this data to verify your cron jobs are running successfully
	- ## Syslog
		- Standard for creating and transmitting logs
			- Can refer to the syslog service
				-
				- Receives and processes syslog messages and listens for events
				- Can write messages to a local file or send to a remote server
		- A transport protocol specifying how to transmit logs over a network (RFC 5424)
			- It is also a transport protocol specifying how to transmit logs over a network
			- Also a data format to define how messages are structured
				- Default uses port 514 for plain text messages and port 6514 for encrypted messages
			- A syslog message is any log formatted in syslog message format and consists of a standardized header and message containing the logs contents
		- **The syslog format and Fields**
			- Timestamp
			- Name of the application that generated the event
			- Location in the system where the message originated
			- Priority
			- Can change the format in syslog config file but using the standard format makes it easier to parse analyze and route syslog events
			-
			  ```shell
			  Jun 4 22:14:15 server1 sshd[41458] : Failed password for root from 10.0.2.2 port 22 ssh2
			  <34>1 2019-06-05T22:14:15.003Z server1 sshd - - pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication
			  failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=10.0.2.2
			  ```
		- ### Standardized message format
			- Support the structuring of this message, **syslog facilities are available to denote which part of the system the log comes from**
				- Achieved by attaching a number to the message
			- **Priority** can be attached to a message using a number between 0 and 7
