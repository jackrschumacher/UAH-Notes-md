				  “Nature displayed a single aspect only,throughout the cosmos; Chaos, was its name,a shapeless, unwrought mass of inert bulk. (8-10) Some god (of kinder nature) settled this dispute by separating earth from heaven, and then by separating sea from earth and fluid aether from the denser air; and after these were separated out.(26-30)”  
				    
				  >   
				    
				  “Heat makes the middle zone unlivable, and the two outer zones are deep in snow; between these two extremes, he placed two others of temperate climate, blending cold and warmth. (68-71) now man was born, either because the framer of all things, the fabricator of this better world created man out of his own divine substance--or else because Prometheus took up a clod ...... molded it into the shape of gods, who govern all. (108-117)”  
- #### The Golden Age
  
  >   
  
  "men had no fear of any punishment, nor did they read of threatened penalties  
  engraved in bronze (129-31)  
  No rake had been familiar with the earth (141)  
  As yet no pine tree on its mountaintop had been chopped down and fitted out to ship. (134-35)"  
- #### The Silver Age
  
  >   
  
  "When Saturn was dispatched to Tartarus, Jove ruled the world.  
  (155-56)  
  Jupiter made the ancient springtime shorter  
  by adding onto it three seasons more:  
  now winter, summer, an erratic fall,  
  and a brief spring filled out the fourfold year. (158-61)"  
- #### The Bronze Age
  
  >   
  
  "crueler by nature and much more disposed,  
  to savage warfare, but not yet corrupt  
  (170-71)"  
- #### The Iron Age
  
  >   
  
  "all forms of evil burst upon this time (173)  
  Now ships spread sail, though sailors until now knew nothing of them; pines that formerly had stood upon the summits of their mountains,  
  turned into keels. (178-81)"  
- #### War with the Giants
  
  >   
  
  "the race of Giants plotted (we hear) to rule in heaven by themselves: they brought together mountains in a heap and piled them up to reach the lofty stars; then the omnipotent father launched a bolt that shattered Mount Olympus at the base,  
  so Pelion came crashing down from Ossa.  
  (205-12)"  
- #### Lyacon
  
  >   
  
  "Gods take this path to the royal apartments  
  of Jove the Thunderer; on either side  
  are palaces with folding doors flung wide,  
  and filled with guests of their distinguished owners. (232-35)"  
  
  >   
  
  "The age's infamy had reached our ears; hoping to disprove it, | glided down from the summit of Olympus, concealing my godhood in a human form,  
  and walked upon the earth. (293-97)  
  By signs | let them know a god had come, and common folk began to offer prayers;  
  at first Lycaon mocked their piety (306-8)  
  He planned to take me, overcome with sleep,  
  and murder me as | lay unawares;  
  that was his way of getting at the truth. (312-14)"  
- #### The Flood
  
  >   
  
  "Neptune, his sky-blue brother, aids him with waves of fresh auxiliaries. The tyrant calls his rivers to assemble  
  beneath his roof... (381-84)  
  Now unrestrained, the sea conceals the hills, and strange new waves beat at the mountaintops; the greater part are drowned beneath the waves,  
  while those spared drowning perish of starvation. (328)"  
- #### Deuclaion and Pyrrha
  
  >   
  
  "There Mount Parnassus raises its twin peaks, piercing the clouds and seeking out the stars; in this place (which alone was unsubmerged) Deucalion, and she who shared his bed, borne on a little raft, had come to land.  
  (436-440)  
  Go from my temple now, with your heads covered and your robes unbound; behind you, toss the bones of your great mother!  
  (527-29)"  
- #### Second Creation
  
  >   
  
  "So when the earth, still completely covered  
  with fresh muck from that just receded flood,  
  was heated by the sun's rays, she produced countless species; some were the old ones, restored, and others were monsters, novel in their shapes.  
  (602-6)  
  Unwillingly, the earth bore you, as well, enormous Python, serpent quite unknown to all prior ages—you, who would become a terror to the newly fashioned folks,  
  so very like a mountainside you were;  
  (607-11)"  
- #### Apollo and Daphne
  
  >   
  
  " What are you doing with such manly arms, lascivious boy? That bow befits our brawn, wherewith we deal out wounds to savage beasts and other mortal foes, unerringly.  
  (634-37)  
  Your arrow, Phoebus, may strike everything;  
  mine will strike you: as animals to gods,  
  your glory is so much the less than mine! (644-46)"  
  
  >   
  
  "i Cupid struck Peneus' daughter [Daphne],  
  while the other pierced Apollo to his marrow  
  (655-56)  
  One is in love now, and the other one  
  won't hear of it, for Daphne calls it joy  
  to roam within the forest's deep seclusion,  
  where she, in emulation of the chaste  
  goddess Phoebe [Diana], devotes herself to hunting.  
  (657-61)  
  Alas, there is no herbal remedy for the love that | must suffer, and the arts  
  that heal all others cannot heal their lord—  
  (723-25)"  
- Hunting metaphors increasingly common
  
  >   
  
  "Help me, dear father! If your waters hold divinity, transform me and destroy that beauty by which | have too well pleased!  
  (751-53)  
  her supple trunk is girdled with a thing layer of fine bark over her smooth skin; her hair turns into foliage, her arms grow branches, sluggish roots adhere to feet that were so recently swift,  
  her head becomes the summit of a tree;  
  all that remains of her is a warm glow.  
  (756-62)"  
- #### Jove and Io/Jove
  
  >   
  
  "Ovid's seamless links  
  Here is the house, the seat, the inner chambers  
  of the great river; here Peneus holds court [the father of Daphne] in his rocky cavern and lays down the law  
  to water nymphs and tributary streams. (793-96)  
  Inachus was the only river absent, concealed in the recesses of his cave he added to his volume with tears he grimly wept for his lost daughter lo.  
  (806-9)"  
  
  >   
  
  "| am he who hurls the roaming thunderbolt— don't run from me!  
  But run she did, through Lerna and Lyrcea, until the god concealed the land entirely beneath a dense dark mist and seized her and dishonored here.  
  (828-32)  
  Juno, however, happened to look down  
  on Argos, where she noticed something odd:  
  swift-flying clouds had turned day into night (833-35)"  
  
  >   
  
  "Having intuited his wife's approach, Jove had already metamorphosed lo into a gleaming heifer—a beauty still  
  even as a COW.  
  (846-49)  
  Jove, lying to forestall all inquiries as to her origin and pedigree, replied that she was born out of the earth.  
  Then Juno asked him for her as a gift.  
  (853-56)"  
  
  >   
  
  "Juno feared Jove had more such tricks in mind,  
  and couldn't feel entirely secure  
  until she'd placed this heifer in the care  
  of Argus, the watchman with a hundred eyes. (866-69)  
  and when she tried to utter a complaint she only mooed—a sound which terrified her, fearful as she now was of her own voice.  
  (883-85)  
  but with her hoof, she drew lines in the dust, and letters of the words she could not speak  
  told the sad story of her transformation. (899-901)"  
- #### Stories within stories
  
  >   
  
  "Argus, struggling to stay awake:  
  even though Slumber closes down some eyes,  
  others stay vigilant. Argus inquired  
  how the reed pipes, so recently invented,  
  had come to be, and Mercury responded. (949-52)  
  the god [Pan], assuming that he had captured Syrinx, grasped instead a handful of marsh reeds! and while he sighed, the reeds in his hands, stirred by his own breath, gave forth a similar, low-pitched complaint! (974-78)"  
  
  >   
  
  "O Argus, you are fallen, and the light in all your lamps is utterly put out:  
  one hundred eyes, one darkness all the same!  
  (995-97)  
  The goddess was now pacified, and lo at once began regaining her lost looks, till she became what she had been before;  
  (1020-22)"  
- #### Phaethon (as link too book 2)
  
  >   
  
  "Her son, Epaphus, is believed to be  
  sprung from the potent seed of mighty Jove, and temples may be found in every city wherein the boy is honored with his parent.  
  He had a friend, like him in age and spirit, named Phaethon, the sun god's child. One day this boy was boasting, and in vanity  
  would not take second place to Epaphus,  
  so proud he as that Phoebus was his father.  
  (1034-39)"

- #### Start of Book 2
  
  >   
  
  "There stood the regal palace of the Sun, soaring upon its many lofty columns,  
  with roof of gold and fire-flashing bronze,  
  and ceilings intricate with ivory,  
  and double-folding doors that shone with silver.  
  (1-5)  
  Soon as the son of Clymene had climbed the steep path leading to the dwelling place of his reputed parent, he went in and turned at once to meet his father's gaze— though at some distance, for he could not bear such brightness any closer.  
  (24-29)"  
  
  >   
  
  "in attendance on his léff@hd right stood Day and Month and Year and Century, and all the Hours, evenly divided; fresh Spring was there, adorned with floral crown, and Summer, naked, bearing ripened grain, and Autumn, stained from treading out her grapes, and Winter with his gray and frosty locks. And sitting in the middle of these figures, the all-seeing Sun looked upon the youth,  
  who quaked with terror at such novel sights.  
  (32-41)"  
  
  
  "You seek a gift that is too great for you,  
  beyond your strength, beyond your boyish years.  
  Out of your ignorance, you seek much more than even gods are able to control,  
  for though each god may do just as he pleases, none but myself may set his heel upon  
  the fire-bearing axle. No—not even he  
  who governs vast Olympus...  
  when | look down on the earth and seas, fear often makes me tremble, and the heart  
  within my breast is seized with palpitations! (73-74, 76-81, 89-90)"  
  
  
  "Perhaps you think that there are sacred groves and cities of the gods along the way, temples displaying all the gifts of wealth? Not so: your path is full of lurking perils as well as images of savage beasts. And if you hold this course unswervingly, you'll find the horns of Taurus in your way, the Archer and the gaping jaws of Leo, and Scorpio, whose long and curving arms sweep one away, while the curving arms of Cancer  
  sweep broadly in the opposite direction.  
  (104-14)"  
- "But his rebellious son refused to listen and adamantly kep to his design.
  (142-43)  
  For the first time, then, the Great and Little Bears knew the sun's heat and tried—in vain, for it was not permitted— to plunge into the sea.  
  (229-32)  
  Athos burns, Cilician Taurus and Timolus burn, and Oeta, too; Mount Ida, which had once been full of fountains, now runs dry and burns; Muse-haunted Helicon and Haemus (not yet associated with Oeagrus); Etna (already blazing) blazes twice.  
  (289-95)"  
  "Now terrified, it is impossible for him to use the reins that he was given.  
  (226-27)  
  no solution to his problem may be found,  
  and stunned by ignorance, cannot decide if he should hold the reins or let them go— he doesn't even know his horses' names!  
  (257-61)"  
  
  "Before he would commit himself, however, the father almighty made the other gods (especially the god who gave his son  
  the chariot) swear that the gravest fate  
  hung over all, unless he should take action. And then he sought the pinnacle of heaven, whence he was wont to parcel out the rain clouds widely over the earth, and whence he moved the thunder and sent forth his lightning bolts. and so he thundered and released a bolt  
  of lightning from beside his ear that drove the hapless driver from his spinning wheels  
  and from his life: fires put cruel fires out.  
  (402-10, 413-16)"

	  why, I'm the son of Jove! If mighty deeds  
	  are what you marvel at, marvel at mine!  
	  | seek both hospitality and rest." (874-78)  
	  "A time will come when your bright golden tree will be despoiled, Atlas; and the spoils **will go to one who styles himself the son of Jove"**  
	  (880-82)"

  >   
  
  "Ammon had condemned Andromeda (the one unjust, the other innocent) to pay the price for her own mother's speech. (918-20) the **sea erupted with the roar of a great beast who rose up as he breasted the wide water.** (943-45) so Perseus, through the resistless air swoops and dives at the monster from behind, and plunges his sword right up to the hilt into the shoulder of the raging beast. (979-82)"  
- The great beast is the kraken
- #### Perseus and Medusa
  
  "Now tell us, gallant Perseus, how strength and cleverness let you lay hands upon that head whose hair is woven through with snakes. (1050-52) a place beneath frigid Mount Atlas, guarded by its bulk, within whose entryway two sisters live, daughters of Phorcys, who shared a single eye: while one was passing it off to the other, her pass was intercepted by our hero."  
  
  "he came at last to where the Gorgon lived. And everywhere, in fields, along the roads, he witnessed the sad forms of men and beasts no more themselves, but changed now into stone, misfortunates, who'd glimpsed Medusa once. (1062-66) He too once looked upon her image, but it had been reflected in the shield of bronze our hero bore in his left hand; and while sleep held Medusa and her snakes, he struck her head off; from their mother's blood sprang swift Pegasus and his brother both. (1068-73)"

- Procne and Philomela tell Tereus that he has eaten his son-Tereus goes mad
- ### Of Praise and Punishment
- Who is worthy of praise and what social position, social standing, or outright divinity have to do with it?
- How does ovid think through social class even as he thinks through relationships between the human and divine
- Where is justice in these stories? Is justice ever served or is this merely as cycle of violence?
  
  "Minerva has been judging storytelling contests. "To praise is insufficient," she reflected; "we will be praised—and we will not permit those who belittle our divinity to go unpunished!" (4-7)"  
  
  "who (it was said) accepted praise that set her above the goddess in the art of weaving, a girl renowned not for her place of birth nor for her family, but for her art: her father, ldmon, came from Colophon, and (like the mother that Arachne lost) was of plebeian origin, a tradesman who steeped the thirst wool in purple dye. (9-16) They came not just to see the finished product, but to watch her working, for such comeliness and grace were present when she plied her art (24-26)"  
- **Arachne is cocky- **brags about her own skill and ticks off Minerva (Athena)
	- Minerva reveals herself as Arachne brags
	- Arachne is not terrified although the others around her are
		- Will not back down
		    
		  >   
		    
		  ""Let her compete with me, and if she wins  
		  I'll pay whatever penalty she sets!"  
		  (36-37)  
		  Pallas [Athena/Minerva] disguises herself as a crone:  
		  puts on a wig of counterfeit gray hair  
		  and, with a staff to proper her tottering limbs,  
		  begins to speak...  
		  (38-41)  
		  Heed my advice: seek all the fame you wish  
		  as best of mortal weavers, but admit  
		  the goddess as your superior in skill.  
		  (43-45)"  
- Although the gods are immortal, they are shown to be more animalistic, not really thinking etc.
  
  
  "Not Envy could have faulted this;  
  Pallas did not, yet, bitterly resenting  
  her rival's success, the goddess warrior  
  ripped it, with its convincing evidence  
  of celestial misconduct, all asunder;  
  and with her shuttle of Cytorian boxwood,  
  struck at Arachne's face repeatedly!  
  She could not bear this, the ill-omened girl,  
  and bravely **fixed a noose around her throat;**  
  while she was hanging, Pallas, stirred to mercy,  
  lifter her up and said:  
  "Though you will hang,  
  you must indeed live on, you wicked child:  
  So that future will be no less fearful  
  than your present is, may the same punishment  
  remain in place for you and yours forever!"  
  (183-197)"  
- ### Niobe
  
  
  "Before her wedding day,  
  when she was living in Maeonia,  
  Niobe knew this girl; nevertheless,  
  the punishment her countrywoman suffered  
  did not convince Niobe to defer  
  to the immortals, and to treat with them  
  as with superiors.  
  (212-18)  
  "What madness is this," she said, "to prefer  
  gods that you've only heard of to the ones  
  you've actually seen? Why cultivate  
  Latona's altars and deny me mine?  
  (247-50)"  
  
  
  "Before her wedding day,  
  when she was living in Maeonia,  
  Niobe knew this girl; nevertheless,  
  the punishment her countrywoman suffered  
  did not convince Niobe to defer  
  to the immortals, and to treat with them  
  as with superiors.  
  (212-18)  
  "What madness is this," she said, "to prefer  
  gods that you've only heard of to the ones  
  you've actually seen? Why cultivate  
  Latona's altars and deny me mine?  
  (247-50)"  
  
  ""Then *dare* prefer Latona's cult to mine,  
  that daughter of the Titan Coeus,  
  whoever he's supposed to be!  
  (274-76)  
  He gave her a place, unstable though it was,  
  where she became the parent of—just two!  
  One seventh of the yield of our womb!  
  Blessed am I (who ever would deny it?),  
  and (who can doubt it?) blessed will I be  
  forever, safely kept by my abundance.  
  Fortune would find me far too great to harm:  
  though she took many, I'd have many more.  
  (284-301)"  
  
  "**Seething with indignation at this treatment**,  
  Latona, on the summit of Mount Cynthus,  
  addressed her children, the immortal twins:  
  "Just look at this, now! l, a goddess who  
  gives way to no one else, except for Juno,  
  and proud of having borne the pair of you [Phoebus/Apollo and Phoebe],  
  now find my divinity in doubt!  
  (302-8)  
  Here as he wheeled his steed round in a circle,  
  forcing the bit against its jaws, Ismenus,  
  the earliest burden of his mother's [Niobe's] womb,  
  cried out, "Ah, me!" as the arrow pierced his breast  
  and the reins slid between his lifeless fingers.  
  (328-32)"  
  
  "But who is the victor? In my wretchedness  
  I still have far more children left to me  
  than you in all your bliss! **Thus, even after**  
  **so many deaths, I am the victor still!"**  
  (406-9)  
  And as she prayed, the one for whom she prayed  
  fell dead, the last of them; and now bereft,  
  she sits, surrounded by the lifeless bodies  
  of her sons, her daughters, and her husband,  
  she sits there stilly, rigid in her grief.  
  (430-34)."  
- ### Latona
  
  >   
  
  "The Titan's daughter came to them, and knelt  
  at the lake's margin for a cooling drink;  
  the rustic mob forbade her.  
  (493-95)  
  And who would not be won over by  
  such winning words? But they, despite her pleas,  
  continued to restrain her, threatening  
  to do her harm unless she goes away.  
  (514-17)  
  Anger put off thirst, for the Titan's daughter  
  now would no longer beg unworthily,  
  nor could she bear not speaking as a goddess.  
  Turning her palms up to the stars, she cried,  
  "Dwell in this pond of your forevermore!"  
  (523-27)  
  they all avort in ponds and mucky bogs,  
  after their transformation into—frogs.  
  (544-45)"  
- ### Tereus, Procne, and Philomela
- Tereus (King of Thrace) marries Progne (daughter of Pandion-king of Athens)
- Falls in love with her sister Philomela (has sex with her)
	- Cuts her tongue to prevent her from telling her sister- but is still able to communicate by weaving story onto cloth
	    
	  >   
	    
	  "Neighboring nobles assembled, and nearby cities  
	  encouraged their kings to pay condolence calls  
	  [for the death of Amphion, Niobe's husband]  
	  (590-91)  
	  Who would believe that only you, Athens,  
	  did nothing? Warfare kept you from your duty,  
	  for a barbaric horde from overseas  
	  had marched its terror right up to your walls.  
	  Tereus of Thrace had raised that siege  
	  with his auxiliaries, had driven off the foe,  
	  And now was famous for his victory.  
	  And since he was a man of wealth and power,  
	  and a descendant of the god of war,  
	  King Pandion had bonded with Tereus  
	  by joining him in marriage to his daughter,  
	  Procne.  
	  (601-12)"  
	    
	  "Five autumns passed,  
	  then Procne coaxed her husband with these words:  
	  "If I am at all pleasing in your sight,  
	  then either let me visit with my sister  
	  or let her visit with me"  
	  (630-34)  
	    
	  When he first saw her, Tereus caught fire  
	  as instantly as ripe grain or dry leaves,  
	  or as hay stored in a barn goes up in blazes.  
	  (654-66)  
	    
	  he said this was merely Procne's wish,  
	  and added tears, as though they too were part  
	  of his commission. By the gods above,  
	  what utter blindness dwells in human hearts!  
	  (674-77)  
	    
	  Nevertheless, if the gods are watching this,  
	  if heavenly power means anything at all,  
	  If, with my honor, all has not been lost,  
	  somehow or other I will punish you;  
	  **I'll cast aside my modesty and speak**  
	  **of what you've done; if I escape this place,**  
	  **I'll go among the people with my tale.**  
	  (781-87)  
	  And after these outrages, he returned  
	  to Procne, who at sight of him inquired  
	  about her sister. Tereus replied  
	  with practiced sobs and a convincing tale  
	  of how she died—a story that his tears made  
	  altogether credible.  
	  (812-17)  
	  he takes her tongue instead.  
	  (799)  
	  And yet from suffering  
	  comes native wit, and often cleverness  
	  is born of misery. Upon her loom,  
	  she hangs a Thracian web and starts to weave  
	  threads of deep purple on a white background,  
	  depicting the crime.  
	  (829-34)"  
- He is like Apollo and Daphne-driven by insatiable lust

  "While Procne was still speaking to her sister,  
  Itys came to his mother, who at once  
  realized what she could do, and said,  
  taking him in with her unfeeling eyes,  
  "How very like his father the boy is!"  
  she turned to look upon her sister's face,  
  and then turned back and forth between them, wildly.  
  (897-901, 912-13)  
  How can it be that this one calls me mother,  
  while that one cannot call me sister?  
  (916-17)"  
  
  "Now Tereus, all unaware, receives  
  an invitation to attend a feast  
  which his wife falsely claims to be a rite  
  of the Athenians: husbands only may  
  partake of it; all slaves are sent away  
  and all attendants: Tereus dines alone  
  (937-42)  
  Procne is unable  
  to hide her savage joy; and eager now  
  to be the bearer of misfortune cries,  
  "The one that you are seeking is within!"  
  (947-50)  
  One flies off to the woods,  
  the other finds her refuge under roofs.  
  he turns into a stiffly crested bird  
  with a huge beak in place of his long sword:  
  the hoopoe, which seems armed as though for war.

  >   
  
  Meanwhile, along Megara's coast, King Minos  
  was pillaging, and trying out his forces  
  against its capital, now held by Nisus,  
  who had, among the venerable locks  
  of gray upon his head, a tuft of purple,  
  which guaranteed the safety of his realm.  
  (7-12)  
  she knew Europa's son the best of all,  
  the countenance of Minos being more  
  familiar to her than it should have been.  
  (27-29)  
  
  In peacetime, Scylla, daughter of King Nisus,  
  would often come and toss a pebble here.  
  (20-21)  
  As she set gazing at his tents, she said  
  "What should I feel about this dreadful war?  
  (52-53)  
  
  and certainly he wages a just war  
  Of retribution for his murdered son [Androgeous, killed under mysterious circumstances in Athens] ;  
  his motive will prevail, as will the arms  
  advancing it. I think that we are lost.  
  (72-75)  
  Much better would it to be  
  for him to conquer us without delay,  
  without exterminating our folk  
  or being hurt himself.  
  (78-81)  
  
  the daughter  
  slips silently into her father's chambers  
  and robs him of his fated lock.  
  (112-14)  
  I surrender  
  myself, my nation, and my gods as well,  
  and seek no other recompense but you;  
  receive this pledge that guarantees my love,  
  this purple lock—which is no lock at all,  
  but my father's head!  
  (121-26)  
  Her father, hovering on yellow wings  
  (for he had just been changed into an osprey),  
  caught sight of her and dove to the attack.  
  Feathers appear upon her hands; transformed  
  into a bird, she is now known as Ciris,  
  and has this name from the clipped lock of hair.  
  (197-99, 204-6)  
- ### Minos and Adriane
  
  The scandal of his family had grown  
  past all concealment; not the mother's [Pasiphae] foul  
  adultery was proven by the strange  
  form of the Minotaur, half man, half bull.  
  Minos determined to remove the cause  
  of this opprobrium from his abode,  
  enclosing it within a labyrinth  
  devised and built by Daedalus.  
  (212-19)  
  
  Minos confined the monstrous form within  
  the labyrinth, and twice it had been fed  
  on the blood of sacrificed Athenians;  
  after another nine-year interval,  
  the third demand for tribute doomed the creature,  
  when, by the aid of Princess Ariadne,  
  the path back to the hidden entranceway,  
  which none before had ever reached again,  
  was rediscovered when the thread was wound;  
  then Theseus abducted Minos' daughter  
  and sailed to Dia, where he cruelly  
  abandoned his companion to her wailing.  
  (233-35)  
- Assume that most readers already know the story
  
  
  Meanwhile, detesting Crete and his long exile,  
  and longing to return to his own nation,  
  Daedalus found that an escape by sea was closed to him.  
  (252-54)  
  Icarus,  
  his boy, was standing close by, unaware  
  of any danger in the things he handled;  
  he smiled as he snatched at wisps of feathers blown  
  from his father's workbench by a passing breeze,  
  or left a thumbprint in the golden wax  
  and playfully got in his father's way.  
  (269-75)  
  
  And as he works and as he warns the boy,  
  the old man's cheeks are dampened by his tears;  
  the father's hands are trembling as he gives  
  his son a not-to-be-repeated kiss,  
  and lifts off on his wings into the air.  
  (291-95)  
  Some fisherman whose line jerks with his catch,  
  some idle shepherd leaning on his crook,  
  some plowman at his plow, looks up and sees  
  something astonishing, and thinks them gods,  
  who have the power to pass through the air.  
  (303-7)  
- ### Daedalus and Perdix
  
  
  As he entombs his child's pathetic corpse,  
  he is observed from where a rank ditch drips,  
  by a chatty partridge, who chirps cheerfully  
  and makes his wing tips flutter in applause  
  (328-31)  
  Daedalus envied him, and headlong hurled  
  this lad of precepts from a precipice

- Where is justice in these stories? Is there ever justice or merely a cycle of violence?
