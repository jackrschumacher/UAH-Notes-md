	  <aside>
	  💡
	  
	  **Exposition**

	  Bridge containing modulation from home key to new key
	  Second theme in new key
	  Closing section in key of second theme
	  **Development**
	  New treatment of themes; modulations to different keys
	  **Recapitulation**
	  First theme in tonic key
	  Bridge
	  Second theme in tonic key

## Exposition
- Strong conflict between the tonic key and the new key
- Bridge or Transition → leads to the second theme
- Usually a repeat sign at the end of the exposition in order to indicate if it should be played again
## Development
- Most dramatic section of the movement
- Rapid modulations and the harmonic tension is heightened
- Themes are broken into fragments or motives
## Recapitulation
- Brings resolution as we hear the first theme in the tonic key
## Coda
- Powerful feeling of conclusion is attained by following recapitulation with another section
- Coda rounds off a movement by repeating themes or developing them further
- Always ends in the tonic key
- Sonata form is exceptionally flexible and subject to endless variation
- Viewed as a set of principles that serve to shape and unify contrasts of theme and key
## Symphony No 40
- Controlled agitation in opening
- Persistence of this rhythmic pattern gives the music a sense of urgency
- Melody is balanced and symmetrical

# Theme and Variation

- A
- 1(A’)
- 2(A’’)
- 3(A’’’)
		  
		  $$
		  a^1,a^2,a^3,etc.
		  $$
- Each variation is unique
	- Usually same length as the theme
	- Changes of melody, rhythm, harmony, accompaniment, dynamics, or tone color
	- Core melody may appear in the bass or it may be repeated in a diff key
- Composer might invent an original melody or use someone else
# Minuet and Trio
- Often used as the third movement in classical symphonies
- First appeared at Court of Louis XIV
- Movement of a symphony is written for listening, not dancing
	- It is in triple meter 3/4
	- ABA form
- Minuet- A
- Trio - B

- Minuet is structurally the simplest movement of a symphony or quartet
- In many of Beethoven’s works, the third movement is not a minuet but related form called a scherzo
-
# Rondo
- Rondo → Tuneful main theme (A) that returns several times-alternation with other themes
	- AVACA
	- ABACABA
- Main theme is usually stated in the tonic key, its return is all the more welcome
- Rondo form is often combined with elements of sonata form to produce a sonata-rondo
	- Contains a development section like that in sonata form is outlined ABA-development-ABA
# The Classical Symphony
- Greatest contribution of the classical period to orchestral music is symphonies
	- Haydn = 1-4 symphonies
	- Mozart = 40+
	- Beethoven = 9
- Symphony → Extended, ambitious composition typically lasting between twenty and 45 min. Uses the expanded range of tone color and dynamics of the classical orchestra
	- Usually consists of four movements that evoke a wide range of emotions through contrasts of tempo and mood
- Vigorous- Dramatic fast movement
	- Usually the most dramatic movement
	- Sonata form
- A lyrical slow movement
	- Most likely to find broad, songlike melodies here
	- Sonata form: ABA
- Dancelike movement (minuet or scherzo)
	- For Haydn and Mozart is generally a minuet and trio which may be in a moderate or fairly quick tempo
	- Varies from courtly dance to a peasant romp or vigorous piece that is not very dancelike
		- Beethoven likes fast, energetic scherzos
- A brilliant or heroic fast movement
	- Concluding movement of a symphony by Haydn or Mozart is fast, lively and brilliant but somewhat lighter in mood than the opening statement
- In most of the classical symphonies each movement is a self contained composition with its own set of themes
- A theme in one movement will only rarely reappear in a later movement
- Importance of the symphony lasted throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first
