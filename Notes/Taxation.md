					- Increasing tax rates with taxable base incomes → rich pay higher taxes
				- **Average tax rate**
					- Total taxes divided by total income
				- **Marginal tax rate**
					- Rate paid on last dollar of income
					- Your tax bracket corresponds to your marginal tax rate
						- Higher than average tax rate because of the progressive tax system

					- Ex: Marginal and average tax are the same for everyone
				- **Regressive tax system**
					- System in which the lower the income the higher percentage of income paid in taxes
					- Ex: Marginal and average tax rates decrease as the income rises
